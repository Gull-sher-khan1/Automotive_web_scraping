More vehicles made but less energy used in 2023 with an 18 decline in CO2 emissions from factory production. Enhancing UKs competitiveness could help deliver more than a million Britishbuilt zero emission vehicles every year by 2035. Britains automotive sector is today urging the new Labour government to use the industrys decarbonisation success to the UKs economic advantage as a new report shows direct carbon emissions from vehicle factories halved over the past 25 years helping position the country as the ideal place to produce the next generation of zero emission vehicles. The 25th Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders SMMT Sustainability Report published today shows the amount of CO2 directly emitted in vehicle production more than halved 54 compared with 1999 levels a major milestone achieved through massive industry investment. At the same time the amount of energy and water used per vehicle was slashed by 18.0 and 17.7 respectively last year with usage now 33 and 42 below 1999 levels. UK manufacturers are also helping cut onroad emissions with record volumes of electrified vehicles leaving factory lines in 2023 as output rose by almost half 48.0.1 Recent independent analysis suggests that with the right investment conditions by 2035 more than a million ZEVs a year could be rolling off UK factory lines exported worldwide and fuelling billions of pounds of domestic economic growth.2 With the new governments commitment to an industrial strategy and its already published Automotive Sector Plan SMMTs new report signposts the UKs green growth potential with automotive its driving force. Collaboration will be crucial making the UK even more globally competitive attracting investment not just in finished vehicle manufacturing but in its supply chains and adjacent sectors. Providing more sustainable and affordable energy is pivotal as are free and fair trade agreements which promote UKmade products globally while ensuring access to critical raw materials. A mass UK market for ZEVs is also needed given manufacturers seek to locate close to where their products are sold. Meanwhile a diverse and skilled workforce that can design build manufacture maintain and repair ZEVs is fundamental to a successful transition. Mike Hawes SMMT Chief Executive said Britains automotive sector has been cutting carbon for decades and this new milestone is significant not just for industry but for the nations move to net zero. We look forward to working with the new government to deliver its green growth agenda that puts Britain at the front of the queue for global investment and sustainability leadership. Automotive can be the driving force behind this strategy reducing carbon emissions still further while growing the economy improving air quality and delivering new jobs and skills for people across the country. The automotive industry is vital to the wider UK economy with autorelated manufacturing worth 93 billion and delivering 22 billion value added while typically investing around 4 billion a year in research and development. The sector includes more than 25 manufacturers building over 70 vehicle models plus specialist small volume manufacturers supported by some 2500 supply chain businesses. As a result the industrys contribution to employment is significant with more than 198000 jobs directly in manufacturing and 813000 in total across the automotive industry. Many of these are outside London and the Southeast with wages around 13 above the UK average. Automotive also supports jobs in key sectors such as steel chemicals plastics rubber advertising finance and logistics. 7 MEASURES TO MAKE SUSTAINABILITY A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IN THE UK Publishing a green automotive transformation strategy that sets out a holistic joinedup approach and provides a pathway towards the UK automotive industrys ultimate sustainability and circularity goals Introducing a package of fiscal tax and regulatory support measures that attract new investment and ensures domestic vehicle producers are globally competitive Providing support and guidance to empower a sustainable transparent UK supply chain Mobilising a skilled diverse empowered UK workforce Developing a UK regulatory ecosystem in partnership with business that is ambitious deliverable and harmonised with global regulatory requirements and international sustainability objectives Ensuring UK sustainability data requirements match the high ambitions of automotive companies operating across global markets Maintaining and further supporting access to critical raw materials and crossborder trade building supply chain resilience to attract investment in zero emission and sustainability technologies Notes to editors 1 httpsmedia.smmt.co.ukdecember2023ukcarmanufacturing 2 SMMT Vision 2035 page 7 Click to share on Facebook Opens in new windowClick to share on Twitter Opens in new windowClick to share on LinkedIn Opens in new window","2024-07-09 00:00:00","2024-08-02 18:20:50.677377"

Garage owners and managers should always be looking for ways to both improve the service that is given to customers and increase their profit margins. Adding windscreen repair could be a simple way to do just that. Those who havent carried out windscreen repairs before might think I dont know how it works its too expensive I might not get a good result. So lets break down how windscreen repair works then consider which system is right for your business and finally ways to sell a repair to your customer as an add on service. How does it work Windscreen repair simply works by removing air and debris from the break filling it with resin and curing it with an LED lamp. Firstly examine the break then drill out the crater. Place the bridge over the break and the injector into the bridge over the damage. Inject the resin and the plunger pushes it through the tiny cracks all around the break. The pressure on pressure off cycle ensures that air is removed from the break and resin fills the damage. Once that is done remove the bridge add a little pit fill resin to the screen and the damage is cured in 75 seconds with the LED lamp. Remove the excess resin from the screen polish it and you have a screen that is said to be as clear as a new one. Which is the right kit Esprit windscreen repair equipment sell four kits they all do the same quality job but there are some differences in price based on the number of repairs that they will carry out. The elite kit comes with an LED lamp plus enough resin to carry out 40 repairs. Its up to you what you charge for a repair but the company recommends around 2535. If you charge that amount youll have made back the cost of the kit by the time you finish the resin provided and after that you just have to replace resin and other consumables. making each repair going forward cost around 1.50 to carry out giving you a significant profit margin. The compact kit is also available which contains the LED lamp but has enough resin for 20 repairs. This kit is better for the occasional repairer but still contains all the same Esprit products as the elite kit. Finally the classic kit and the compact classic which come with the classic bridge and a UV lamp. This is the companys lowcost option but the kit still comes with all Esprit products and the resin and can be upgraded to use the LED lamp. Selling the repair If your customers vehicle comes in for an MOT a service or another repair look at the screen for any chips or breaks. Repairing sooner is always better as if a break is left the car wont pass its MOT can turn into a large crack normally necessitating a costly windscreen replacement. Make sure your customer knows that when they come to MOT their car windscreen damage will fail the MOT but a repaired windscreen will pass. They dont need to claim on their insurance and possibly lose a no claims bonus. The cost benefits to the customer of repairing rather than replacing are easy to see. Repairs only take around 2030 minutes so they can be carried out as part of the service or MOT. If you charge around 25 for a repair most customers who are having a service MOT or other repairs to their car will agree that this is a lowcost way of preventing the need for a windscreen replacement.

This will include sharing insights on how businesses can overcome recruitment challenges and thrive in todays competitive landscape by adopting a skillsbased hiring strategy. The current recruitment market presents significant challenges with the UK unemployment rate reportedly at 4.4 and an estimated 904000 vacancies between March and May 2024 which is 12 above preCOVID levels. Additionally 93 of hiring managers have reportedly expressed concerns about continued talent shortages. Glen Callum Associates advise an effective solution to these talent shortages is adopting a skillsbased approach to hiring. This method prioritises a candidates skills adaptability and potential over traditional job titles or industry experience. Skillsbased hiring evaluates candidates through practical tasks and scenariobased questions focusing on both hard skills such as data analysis and soft skills like communication and leadership. The approach has reportedly been implemented by 40 of UK recruiters and has led to 43 of businesses shifting their job adverts to focus on skills and competencies rather than qualifications. Whats more 20 of businesses have reportedly removed degree requirements from job adverts. In todays competitive landscape the top skills said to stand out to SMEs include a good work ethic with 38 of businesses valuing this trait highly. Following closely 37 are said to prioritise team players while 31 value quick learners. Confidence is said to be key for 27 of SMEs and the ability to work under pressure is crucial for another 26. Additionally 26 of businesses look for candidates who are a good personality fit for their company. Kayleigh Bradley Senior Recruiter at Glen Callum Associates said Skillsbased hiring offers numerous advantages. It reduces the time to hire by streamlining the recruitment process and decreases hiring costs by lowering expenses associated with lengthy recruitment phases. This approach also improves diversity attracting a broader range of candidates from diverse backgrounds. It enhances talent attraction by drawing in candidates who are genuinely interested and engaged. Importantly companies with solid skillsbased hiring practices saw a 17 increase in employee retention and a 23 increase in productivity according to a 2023 study by Deloitte. To implement a skillsbased approach businesses should consider removing degree requirements from job adverts to attract a wider pool of candidates advises Glen Callum Associates. Updating job descriptions to emphasise the skills required for the job and providing a clear list of responsibilities rather than an exhaustive list of previous experiences and qualifications is also crucial the specialist urges. Additionally using skillsbased assessments such as online tests or scenariobased questions during the interview process can be highly effective. While this approach may not be applicable to all positions it is an efficient way of recruiting for many roles. Kayleigh added At Glen Callum Associates we understand the importance of broadening the talent pool by recognising transferable skills from allied industries. This not only addresses the skills gap but also brings fresh perspectives and innovative approaches to our sector. By adopting a skillsbased approach businesses can attract passionate and capable individuals contributing towards a more diverse and dynamic workforce.

It would be safe to say that the electrification of vehicles powertrains has galvanised the automotive industry in a way that hasnt happened since the introduction of the diesel engine. All of a sudden the cars we drive and how we drive them are regularly headline news and the source of heated debates between rentagob pundits. There is a risk that this fastpaced literally technology will leave the repair sector behind if technicians dont take it upon themselves to join training course and gain some accreditation. To be fair considering the speed with which the government is ordering a switch from ICE vehicles to EVs the aftermarket has done a commendable job of signing up for training on handling EVs. These courses however have mostly focussed on the health and safety aspect of working with EVs. What this training mostly provides workshops is the ability to perform routine service and maintenance tasks in a safe manner with the battery successfully isolated. What most workshops have yet to tackle is anything to do with the battery or indepth diagnostics on EVs. This is something that was emphasised in my recent chat with Delphi Technologies Phil Mitchell. Phil now EMEA workshop solutions technical lead will be familiar to many readers for having provided Delphi training in the UK. He told me that there was a growing problem of specifically Tesla owners finding they were unable to get their vehicles repaired or even serviced or having a tyre changed by independent garages. Why might this be Well in Phils words the aftermarket is fairly scared of Tesla vehicles. Phil contrasts Mr Musks vehiclecumtech company with the legacy brands also active in the EV market noting that when it comes to diagnosing Teslas with aftermarket tools its difficult to know where to start. Up until around a year and a half ago Phil tells me Tesla was a closed book when it came to releasing its data to the aftermarket. It was excruciatingly expensive to access its dealer tools and there were no aftermarket diagnostics tools offering Tesla coverage. So what has Delphi done to help the aftermarket with its Tesla dilemma Phil explains We took a twopronged attack. We are launching diagnostic software with Tesla capabilities and now we are accompanying that with an etraining module on our Delphi Academy to guide technicians through some key diagnostic processes for Teslas. The aim is to provide a full solution for workshops in order to enable them to work on Teslas. No aftermarket diagnostics tool will have as much capability as the dealer tool so will the training academys online course focus simply on the tasks which the tool can complete Not according to Phil We looked at the all the common jobs workshops will be doing the ones they make the most money on and we included lots of information about the cars themselves everything you would need to know to comfortably repair them. But we also look at what jobs you can carry out using the Tesla OE software which you cant using our tool. The 11part elearning course takes users stepbystep through getting set up and acquainted with Teslas and counts towards a users IMI CPD credits.

This time he will examine briefly how a fuel cell converts hydrogen into electricity and then compare the efficiency of an EV and a FCEV. Protonexchange membrane fuel cells also known as polymer electrolyte membrane PEM fuel cells are the type mainly used for vehicles. They produce electricity through the reaction of a fuel hydrogen with oxygen. Water is the only waste product from this type of fuel cell. The reaction between hydrogen and oxygen releases energy. Fuel cells convert a substantial proportion of the chemical energy into electrical energy so are very efficient. All oxidations involve a transfer of electrons between the fuel and oxidant and in a fuel cell this is employed to convert the energy directly into electricity. The working temperature of fuel cells is 50100C but some can be up to 200C. High pressure is also used in the cell in the region of 30 bar. A unit consisting of many fuel cells is referred to as a stack. Individual cells are connected in series just like a normal battery. This forms a stack that meets the necessary voltage and current requirements. The theoretical opencircuit voltage of a hydrogenoxygen fuel cell is 1.23V at room temperature but in practice it is around 1V. Under load conditions the cell voltage is between 0.5 and 0.8V. The stack voltage is usually 400500V. Figure 1 Protonexchange polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell operation Opinion and facts As mentioned previously in my opinion hydrogen is not the future for cars but it will be used for storage and on larger vehicles such as buses and trucks perhaps even for shipping and aviation. Something that is often overlooked is that a hydrogen car is a battery electric vehicle but with considerable added complexity and therefore cost. FCEVs have a lithiumion battery and all the other components that a standard BEV has but they also have a fuel cell stack fuel storage tanks and associated delivery systems. For hydrogen to become a mainstream fuel a new infrastructure will be required at fuel stations. The hydrogen will have to be created compressed delivered and stored. Unfortunately hydrogen consumes a huge amount of energy as it is being created and compressed. Delivering electricity to a charger via the national grid is very efficient. Creating and storing hydrogen when a wind turbine or solar farm is producing more electricity than is needed is an ideal solution. Truck refuelling stations could be located close to where this hydrogen is created to reduce delivery costs. However to roll out a national network of hydrogen charging stations that rival petroldiesel would be a huge task some say we are struggling to roll out enough EV charge points which is a much simpler process. Figure 2 Fuel cell stack from a Toyota Mirai For me the key information that we need to be aware of is how much electricity is needed to run a hydrogen powered vehicle. This image shows that the BEV is much more efficient Grid capacity will need to expand to charge more BEVs but to create enough hydrogen for the equivalent FCEVs the expansion would need to be more than double. As a clean fuel there is no doubt that hydrogen has exciting potential. The fact that big names like Bosch VW BMW Toyota and others are investing in it definitely tells us something. However there are a lot of technical challenges yet to solve not least of which is the creation and distribution of hydrogen. Hydrogenpowered cars have a lot going for them. Theyre clean and offer good range. But on further examination the amount of upstream electricity they use makes them less attractive. Larger vehicles and local storage seem like good options but we have all got a lot more to learn about the best way to use the benefits of hydrogen.

This usually arises from the idea that using a hydrogenpowered vehicle will be much the same as using a petrol or dieselpowered one so we dont need to change our habits. We would be able to fill it up almost anywhere giving a range of several hundred miles so when the need arises we can drive the entire length of the country. After all you cant do that in an EV they often add. Figure 1 An FCEV is a complex machine I agree you cant do that journey nonstop in an EV yet but how many times do you need to do it anyway Their next argument is usually something about how the national grid will not be able to charge all the EVs. In response I add that a hydrogen car uses at least three times some say more as much electricity as a pure EV or uses dirty hydrogen from a gas refinery. Their last resort is usually something related to all the rare earth metals used in an EV and its battery. At this point I remind them that a fuel cell electric vehicle FCEV has all the same technology as an EV including a battery but it also has a complex fuel cell with associated highpressure tanks and pipes. The Toyota Mirai for example even has a massive supercharger. Even at this stage of the discussion the desire not to have to change what they do in my opinion means that they are still not convinced that hydrogen is not the fuel of the future for cars. I need to try harder so here we go Hydrogen Clean green or yellow hydrogen is created by electrolysing water using electricity from renewable resources. Electrolysis is the decomposition of a chemical by passing an electric current through a liquid. Currently most hydrogen is currently obtained by steam reformation from natural gas meaning the CO2 produced is roughly equivalent to that produced by petrol or diesel engines. Hydrogen can be used in fuel cells to power electric motors or can be burned directly in internal combustion engines. Fuel cells are the most efficient. Hydrogen is an environmentally friendly fuel at the point of use as it only produces water as a byproduct. It also has a very high energy density. However it has to be compressed to between 350 and 700 bar to achieve a suitable tank volume for a normal vehicle. Figure 2 Basic electrolysis process Advantages No air pollutants or greenhouse gases at the point of use in a fuel cell It produces only NOx when burned in internal combustion engines. Disadvantages Expensive to produce and is only available at a few locations Fuel cells are an expensive addition to an EV. Summary In this article I have shared my opinion on hydrogen as a fuel for cars and looked at how clean hydrogen is created. Next time we will examine how a fuel cell converts this clean hydrogen back into electricity and how the efficiency of an EV and an FCEV compare.

There are two main methods stationary WPT dynamic WPT With stationary charging the electric energy is transferred to a parked vehicle. In dynamic wireless charging systems the energy is transferred via a special driving lane equipped with a primary coil system at a high power level to a secondary coil of a moving vehicle. Because the range of most EVs is now good the need for dynamic charging has reduced. I will therefore concentrate on static or stationary WPT. To wirelessly charge a suitably equipped electric vehicle simply parks over an induction pad and charging commences automatically. Just like with wired connections the rate of charge is set from within the vehicle. There are no visible wires or connections. A primary charging pad is buried or set on the ground on a drive or in a garage for example and a secondary pad is integrated onto the vehicle. Figure 1 Inductive wireless charging 1 power supply 2 primary pad 3 wireless electricity and data transfer 4 secondary pad 5 onboard charger and controller 6 battery The power supply Fig.1 takes a mains voltage input and produces highfrequency current gt20 kHz. Its output current is controlled and applied to the primary pad. Power is transferred from the primary pad to the secondary pad using transformer action. The onboard charger takes power from the receiver pad and provides a controlled output to the battery. The controller is required to provide an output that remains independent of the load and the separation between pads. Figure 2 Charging station GroundPad BMW has developed a wireless charging system. As soon as the vehicle has been parked in the correct position above the inductive charging station Fig.2 a simple push of the StopStart button starts the charging process. Once the battery is fully charged the system switches off automatically just as if it was plugged in. The system helps the driver to manoeuvre the car into the correct parking position with the help of a WiFi connection between the charging station and vehicle. An overhead view of the car and its surroundings is displayed in the centre control display. Coloured lines help guide the driver into the correct spot. A graphic icon shows when the correct parking position for inductive charging has been reached. This can deviate from the optimum position by up to 7 cm longitudinally and up to 14 cm laterally. The contactless transfer of energy between the GroundPad and CarPad is conducted over a vertical distance of around 7.5 cm. The GroundPad generates a magnetic field. This induces a voltage in the CarPad which then causes a current flow to the onboard charger just as if the car was plugged in. WPT is designed for slow charging so is ideal for home chargers where for example you simply park the vehicle as normal and charging automatically takes place overnight.

Most EVs allow the operation of heating or cooling when the vehicle is plugged in and charging. Some also allow this function directly from the battery. The most important aspect is that when plugged in this allows the vehicle cabin to be preconditioned on mains power saving battery capacity and increasing range. The two most common operations are Cooling with an electrically driven air conditioner compressor Heating with a highvoltage positive temperature coefficient PTC heater. Figure 1 Setting the temperature on a connected app VW These cooling and heating functions are activated via the cars infotainment system or a connected app. The car can be scheduled to heat or cool its interior to an optimum temperature ready for departure Fig.1. When the car is plugged in electricity is drawn from the mains and not the battery so this has no impact on driving range. Having the screen and windows free of mist and ice also saves time and is a safety improvement because many people drive before the windows are clear. Preconditioning doesnt add miles to the normal range but it will preserve the predicted range available at the start of the journey. Using the air conditioning or heating on a high setting is not needed during the journey so the vehicle will consume less energy. Figure 2 Incar smart climate controls via touch screen Preconditioning can also help the battery. Lithiumion batteries are based on electrochemical reactions that slow down in cold weather. During the winter a battery provides less energy and will lose its charge more quickly. Preconditioning on some vehicles will warm the battery to optimum temperature using power from the mains which will help the battery to work at its optimum. When necessary the battery control unit can also request cooling of the battery. Modern petrol engines have a thermal efficiency under high load conditions of about 40 per cent and about 30 per cent under other conditions. The ICE engine is a ready source of waste heat that can be used in the vehicle cabin but EV heaters have to use electricity. AC systems draw energy from both ICE and EV and will have some impact on the range. EV motors have an efficiency of around 95 per cent and other components such as the DCDC converter power electronics and battery chargingdischarging cycles all produce heat. Engineers are therefore looking at how to use this waste heat to warm EV passengers in cold conditions. Figure 3 Thermal image of a heated steering wheel Another point of interest is that the vehicle cabin temperature is about perceived temperature as well as the measured temperature. New ideas such as electric feet heaters are under development. One already in use is the heated steering wheel. As well as being very nice for cold hands on a cold day the driver feels warmer so less energy is needed for general cabin heating. Cabin zones are often used too when the car just has one occupant. In summary preconditioning can improve the comfort of the driver and passengers look after the high voltage battery and save money.

Tom also chose to be controversial at times saying things like the hydrogen fuel cell car is not the way forward Some of his comments below may be similar but lets keep the discussion going then we all win. Tom hopes most people now agree that the world is changing and therefore we need to change what we do. Electric vehicles on their own are not a solution to environment damage but climate forecasters agree they are a key part of the solution as we transition from fossil fuels. Road transport emissions are significant so a small change has a big effect. One aspect of using EVs we have not covered is how they can form part of a domestic electrical system that has solar panels and storage. In my own house I have 4kW of solar PV panels an 8kWh battery an EV with a 58kWh battery a smart charger and an immersion heater diverter all controlled by an app. I hardly buy any electricity 9p per unit if I do and I run my car most of the time for free. This required an investment but broke even carbon and money after seven years. Now I make a profit. I know as an individual you cant do this if you live in a fourth floor apartment. However the building owner could and each parking space could have a charger there are always solutions. Fire There are many antiEV myths allow me to quench one. A car park fire at Luton airport recently resulted in lots of vehicles burning out social media immediately blamed an EV. Bedfordshire fire service said the blaze started in a diesel car. EVs burn and battery thermal runaway can release toxic flammable gas. In ICE vehicles electrical faults or an overheated engine can cause fuel to burn. Data is still emerging but EVs are much less likely to burn Norways official report says there are four to five times more fires in ICE cars Australia FireSafe found there was a 0.0012 per cent chance of an EV battery fire compared with a 0.1 for ICE Tesla says the number of fires involving their cars from 2012 to 2021 was 11 times lower per mile than for ICE cars. UK evidence is more anecdotal as fire services collect data separately but all state that there are fewer fires in EVs than in ICE equivalents. The EVs reputation is damaged by electric scooters and bikes because many come from unregulated manufacturers and are modified using unreliable internet parts. This area needs regulation as there have already been fires with tragic consequences. And finally Leaving aside motorsports but accepting we must change how we live EVs are far better in every respect than ICE vehicles anyway For more from the EV series click here.","2024-05-08 00:00:00","2024-08-02 18:20:52.212284"

Autotech Group has launched a new division Autotech Connect in a bid to mitigate the growing risk of cybercrime threats and help the automotive aftermarket effectively implement technology into their businesses to improve efficiency and overcome skills gaps. Technology is transforming mobility as software defined vehicles enter the market and the proliferation of connected vehicles continues consumers are increasingly expecting their cars to be an extension of their smart phones. Layered ontop of the skills shortage the lack of training a failure to invest in technology and the risk of cyberattacks garages must engage in building their digital infrastructure to ensure their survival. Through its new Autotech Connect division Autotech Group has secured partnerships with leading hardware software training and IT providers to deliver technology driven solutions that bring their expertise and application knowledge from other industries including government banking and healthcare into the automotive aftermarket. Our intention is to help aftermarket businesses understand the threats and opportunities created by software defined and connected vehicles and through our partners help them navigate the challenges with the aim of increasing productivity reducing risk and exploring potential solutions comments Gavin White CEO of Autotech Group. Struggling to keep up For many years we have talked about the skills shortage how aftermarket businesses are struggling to keep up with the evolving vehicle marketplace and the need for training. The industry particularly independent businesses is permanently on the back foot pedalling to keep up and they are now facing further issues presented by evolving vehicle technology. By using specialists Autotech Connect will help aftermarket businesses implement technology effectively to drive business efficiency build robust cyber security defences and increase productivity. Assisted Reality AR devices to support vehicle technicians is just one part of the Autotech Connect solution. Using AR is a tremendously exciting opportunity and if used correctly can help streamline processes and empower vehicle technicians as the most uptodate technical information they need will be right in front of them. However AR is just one small part of addressing the challenges facing the industry. There is a journey to undertake and the digital foundations must be laid to allow the aftermarket to capitalise. Gavin concludes. Since 2010 Autotech has striven to stay one step ahead creating solutions to support the industry in its quest to keep up with the evolution of vehicles. This has included the launch of dedicated divisions Autotech Training and Autotech Academy to meet the challenges head on and now Autotech Connect.

Electrified vehicle production YTD also down 7.6 to 157224 units representing 37.8 of total output. Latest independent production outlook anticipates UK producing some 910000 cars and light vans this year down 9.3 as factories repurpose. Sector looks forward to working with new government on an industrial strategy with automotive at its core. UK car production fell 7.6 in the first six months of the year according to new figures published today by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders SMMT. Factories turned out 416074 units 34094 fewer than in the same period in 2023 following a 26.6 decline in June caused by multiple model changes. The performance was expected as manufacturers retool lines to make electrified models following some 23.7 billion of UK investment announced last year.1 Amid this transition first half year electrified vehicle battery electric plugin hybrid and hybrid production was down 7.6 in line with overall volumes to 157224 units. This represents more than a third 37.8 of all output unchanged from last year.2 In the same period overall car output for the UK market was up 17.7 to 106157 units but this was not enough to offset a 13.9 decline in production for export with more than sevenin10 cars made destined for customers overseas. Given the importance of exports to UK car production the role of free and fair global trade cannot be overstated especially with the EU which remains by far the most important market for UK car makers taking 55.4 of all exports in the first six months equivalent to 171745 units. The US China Turkey and Australia made up the rest of the top five export locations accounting for a combined 29.4 of all overseas orders. Japan Canada South Korea UAE and Switzerland completed the top 10. Mike Hawes SMMT Chief Executive said The UK auto industry is moving at pace to build the next generation of electric vehicles a transition that can be a growth engine for the entire British economy. The new governments commitments to gigafactories a decarbonised energy supply and a faster planning system will help boost our competitiveness and sustain employment in a sector that delivers well paid skilled jobs nationwide. Amid fierce global competition however industry and government must work quickly to deliver those commitments creating an industrial strategy that enables the growth the economy craves. The latest independent production outlook illustrates how the EV transition is impacting UK light vehicle production which is now expected to decline 9.3 this year to around 910000 units as structural changes are undertaken in British plants. Output is then set to recover to just over 1.1 million units in 2028 when more than half of all UK car and van production is expected to be zero emission and reach some 1.167 million by the end of the decade.3 With the right political industrial and economic conditions by 2035 the UK could cumulatively have produced more than nine million zero emission light vehicles 600000 more than anticipated under current outlooks and worth over 290 billion at factory gate prices.4 SMMTs Vision 2035 Ready to Grow published in June sets out a plan to help deliver such conditions focused on developing the domestic market for EVs industrial transformation reskilling providing clean energy and ensuring free and fair trade with global markets. It dovetails with the the new governments commitment to an industrial strategy and its Automotive Sector Plan and the industry is ready to work with government to ensure the longterm success of the sector and all those who depend on it for their mobility services and livelihoods.

Export demand remains robust up 3.6 yeartodate with seven in 10 vehicles shipped overseas as production for domestic market falls by 14.8. Latest independent outlook expects factories to turn out some 111000 light vans this year as sector looks forward to working with new government on an industrial strategy with automotive at its core. UK commercial vehicle CV manufacturing fell 2.9 in the first six months of the year as 56956 vans trucks taxis buses and coaches left factory gates according to the latest figures published today by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders SMMT. Despite the yearonyear decline wrapped up by a 2.0 drop in output in June as temporary supply chain constraints impacted production overall levels remain high given last years bumper first half and fulfilment of postCovid delivery backlogs.1 Year to date output remains almost a third 31.3 higher than the prepandemic five year average thanks to investment in new plants models and technologies and robust export demand.2 Overseas shipments of UKbuilt CVs many of them zero emission were 3.6 up in the first half at 39168 units equivalent to more than two thirds of all output with the EU taking the lions share 97.2 followed by Australia 1.2 and the US 0.5. This growth was however unable to offset a 14.8 decline in the domestic market. Mike Hawes SMMT Chief Executive said While a decline in output is always disappointing some normalisation following the CV sectors rapid postpandemic recovery was expected. The sector remains in good health with strong global demand for high quality Britishbuilt CVs and plants ramping up EV production to meet current and future needs. However the sector will not rest on its laurels and will work with the new government to deliver the favourable industrial trade and market conditions that are essential if manufacturers are to drive economic growth and decarbonisation in every part of the country. The news comes as the latest independent industry outlook forecasts light CV production to grow to some 110000 units this year. Volumes are then expected to go above 130000 in 2030 providing economic and trading conditions allow.3 The UK already has a reputation as a major player in automotive production with one of the most diverse product bases in the world including everything from massmarket cars to vans trucks buses and specialist and luxury vehicles exported globally. As a result automotive is ideally placed to deliver economic growth in the short and long term. SMMT welcomes the commitments already made by the new government and looks forward to working with policymakers to create a dedicated industrial strategy that fosters competitiveness through investment in skills clean affordable energy free and fair trade vibrant markets and a fair EV transition for all.

As reported in the Shropshire Star Jerry Scagell and Jennie Shaw fell victim to a fraudster that claimed to be a mechanic who was interested in privately buying their Skoda Octavia Scout. The car buyer asked to look under the bonnet while the owner went to get their V5 documents. After then taking the Skoda for a test drive it appeared that oil had leaked all over the engine bay. The car buyer offered 7000 under asking price to take the problem vehicle off their hands. However Scagell resisted the temptation to sell at a knockdown price and instead sent the Octavia to a local garage to investigate. It transpired that the caps to the coolant tank and engine compartment had been removed which had sent oil and water leaking over the engine bay during the test drive the previous day. Repairs cost the couple 400 but they avoided a more costly sum after being duped by the fraudster. The oil scam has been prevalent for years with the RAC warning back in 2018 that the practice from con artists was making a comeback. In this variation of the scam fraudsters can pour oil into the coolant reservoir of the vehicle for sale and then offer a cutprice because they falsely claim the engine is wrecked.","2024-07-29 00:00:00","2024-08-02 18:20:53.136573"

Auto Traders current projections expect a used car market of 7.6 million units in 2024 which is an additional 350000. This will be underpinned by continued strong levels of consumer demand which in June saw the biggest rise on the classifieds giants platform in 15 months while July to date is up 4 yearonyear. The rise is despite challenging market conditions which has seen a 16 drop in stock levels for one to five year old vehicles which have historically been the biggest focus point for franchised dealer used car operations. Used supply will never be the same again The number of subfiveyearold cars on the road by the end of 2024 set to be at their lowest since 1995 current supply complexities are set to deepen. Highlighting the huge impact the shortfall of new cars built and sold over the course of the pandemic has had on stock flow this year there will be 28 fewer cars under five years old in the parc compared to 2019. Looking at the data at a more granular level reveals that the scale of the loss has not been spread equally across all manufacturers with three main factors impacting volumes. Firstly in the two main periods of disruption in factory production some brands were better insulated from plant closures and parts shortages which enabled them to resume or maintain production faster than others. Next there are some brands for which sales volumes were already in decline a trend accelerated by the pandemics supply issues and volume has not recovered to previous levels. Vauxhall Ford and MercedesBenz used car supply warning Indeed some brands will have around half the number of subfiveyearold cars on the road by the end of 2024 including Vauxhall Ford and MercedesBenz which will have 56 560000 cars 54 730000 and 42 310000 fewer cars of that age cohort in the parc respectively. Finally a much smaller handful have seen volumes of this age cohort increase over the period due to more sales 2024 will close with seven times more subfiveyearold MGs and Teslas on the road compared to 2019 and 9 more Kias. This disruption in stock dynamics will have ranging implications for retailers not least the need to source older vehicles requiring more preparation as well as increased competition for stock. In 2019 510yearold cars accounted for just 13 of a franchise retailers forecourt today its nearly a quarter 22. For supermarkets the shift is even more profound rising from around just one in 10 to nearly a third. More EVs entering the used car parc Compounding the challenge is the growing number of electric vehicles entering the parc. By the end of this year Auto Trader estimates around 4 of the cars on the road will be an EV compared to 88 ICE. As a result there will never be more subfiveyearold petrol or diesel cars on the road than there are today with the returning supply increasingly electric. By 2028 around 33 of all under fiveyearold used cars in the parc will be electric up from around 15 by the end of 2024. Inevitably within this trend some brands are also electrifying faster than others. In the coming years both retailers and car buyers will be presented with a very different set of vehicles all of which means supply will never be the same again and retailers will need to adapt. Marc Palmer head of strategy amp insights explained 2024 has had its challenges but overall its performed well and based on the current trajectory our outlook for the rest of the year remains positive. However the heavily nuanced market retailers have had to manage over the last few years is only set to intensify as the combination of supply constraints more electric cars and a changing brand landscape mean the parc will soon look very different. With such a dramatic change in forecourt dynamics sourcing pricing and selling cars are going to require a blend of both instincts and insights to navigate the market ahead. Palmer advised retailers to review their mix by marque age and fuel type to assess whether the increasing electrification and changing brand landscapes will result in disruption to their business. He added that retailers should use data to identify opportunities to determine whether now is the time to start adjusting their stock mix to insulate their business from future supply challenges. Auto Trader has published an interactive analysis on the future of the car parc including a full breakdown by fueltype age cohort and brand.","2024-07-30 00:00:00","2024-08-02 18:20:53.19819"

Ever since the first Seat Leon arrived the motoring media and enlightened motorists have agreed that this is a hatchback that offers superb value and is a credible alternative to the mainstream Golf Astra etc. In fact the fourth generation Seat Leon has won five awards in the UK including 2024s Best Family Car for Value from What Car Magazine. It is a great proposition as the main car of a small family or once in the used car market its ideal as the second car of the household. Now until the end of September Seat has a 4.9 APR personal contract plan offer on the Leon with a 2500 manufacturer deposit contribution. An extra enhancement is an offer of two services for 199. Leon is available with petrol diesel mild hybrid and plugin hybrid powertrains and it is the latter called eHybrid in Seats world that AM recently spent a week with. Like all PHEVs it gives buyers the satisfaction of being able to trek around town under zeroemissions electric power but the confidence of knowing the 1.4litre petrol engine is there to avoid charging stops on longer trips. With a realworld electric range of around 30 miles the car managed plenty of school run trips with no tailpipe emissions. While the official WLTP fuel economy of 217235mpg wont be neared without plenty of those local journeys under battery power a longer motorway drive still gave us mid40s fuel economy. The eHybrid is taxationfriendly too which is a considerable draw for fleets and business owners wholl incur benefitinkind. Its 26gkm CO2 emissions mean a first year VED rate of just 10 and it attracts currently just 2 BIK contrast that with the nonhybrid Leons which have 3031 BIK. At 37880 OTR the car we tested is certainly not the cheapest Leon the range starts at just under 24000 for the bog standard 1.0litre petrol with a relatively frillfree SE trim. But there is much that appealed with our car in FR Sport specification with its 10in multimedia screen 18in alloys leather steering wheel with paddles LED headlamps sports bumpers and ambient lighting.

Honda understands its customers and it knows that many are brand loyal yet there comes a point in retirement when that wellspecd CRV or HRV SUV theyve been enjoying feels just a bit too big. So the Jazz Crosstar is the ideal vehicle for these downsizers. It builds on the topspec Jazz EX model meaning its well equipped as standard. Plus its bespoke front and rear bumpers black side sills and roof rails and slightly higher stance than the standard Jazz all combines to give an adventurous SUVesque feel to this supermini. 7 Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Naturally theres no efficientsapping fourwheeldrive system because this isnt an offroader. But like the rest of them it will happily pootle down lightly rutted tracks and potholed car parks to reach the best dogwalking spots. The Honda Jazz Crosstar is brilliant in car parks and around town in general helped by the high seating position and huge front windscreen the visibility for the driver is unbeatable. Plus theres a tight turning circle light steering and a standard reversing camera. Honda has equipped the Jazz Crosstar with a suite of advanced safety features under the Honda Sensing umbrella which includes adaptive cruise control lane keeping assist automated emergency braking and traffic sign recognition. The everyday practicalities of the Crosstar are clear selling points. Its infotainment system with navigation smartphone connectivity and a highquality audio system is easy to use. The system supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto ensuring seamless smartphone integration. It still has the Jazzs Magic Seat system which offers numerous seating and cargo configurations for even more practicality. Under the bonnet the Honda Jazz Crosstar is powered by a 1.5litre iMMD Intelligent MultiMode Drive hybrid powertrain which can switch seamlessly between EV hybrid and engine drive modes optimising fuel efficiency and reducing emissions. Officially itll return 58.9mpg which is only marginally thirstier than the standard Jazz. Some prospective buyers might not adore the CVT automatic transmission but it is fine once you get used to it. All in all the Jazz Crosstar is well designed for its target market and even its fairly hefty price tag of 29085 or 330ish monthly on a PCP shouldnt be a deterrent.","2024-07-29 00:00:00","2024-08-02 18:20:53.322312"

The previous generation Mini BEV had a poor realworld range as only a limited size battery could fit into the floor. For the fifth generation Mini has developed a new platform that accommodates larger batteries more powerful motors and advanced technology. The result Greater range and improved performance. Depending which model a buyer chooses they can easily take a crosscountry jaunt from East Anglia to Wales and arrive with a smile on their face. The Mini Cooper E is equipped with a 40.7 kWh battery providing up to 190 miles of electric range WLTP. Its 184PS electric motor with 290Nm of torque enables the car to accelerate from 0 to 62mph in 7.3 seconds. On the other hand the Cooper SE boasts a more powerful 218PS motor with 330Nm of torque allowing it to sprint from 0 to 62mph in 6.7 seconds. The SEs larger 54.2 kWh battery extends its range to 250 miles. During road tests by Matt DePrez both cars achieved around 4.0 miles per kWh translating to an estimated range of approximately 160 miles for the Cooper E and 210 miles for the Cooper SE. Suspension differences between the E and SE mean that the SE offers a slightly better ride. Both models are firm yet agile making the Mini Cooper Electric the besthandling model in its segment. Refinement is high for a small car with minimal wind or tyre noise and the Mini feels stable and planted at higher speeds making it wellsuited for longdistance driving. With its threedoors it offers slightly less practicality compared to competitors like the Audi A1 or Toyota Yaris. However the Mini compensates with a highquality interior that feels both modern and premium. The dashboard features a textile covering and the materials used throughout are robust and tactile. The minimalist layout enhances the interiors spacious and futuristic feel. Starting prices for the Mini Cooper E Classic begin at 30000 with Sport and Exclusive trims also available. 6 Advertisement Advertisement In keeping with Minis minimalist theme on board technology is confined to a single central infotainment screen. The circular display provides all the infotainment functions climate controls and acts as an instrument cluster integrating the speedometer into the display. On the move voice control proves a godsend. Buyers choosing the Level 1 equipment package 2000 or standard on Cooper SE get a headup display heated front seats folding door mirrors comfort access and high beam assistant. It should be a musthave for buyers. All Mini Cooper models come with parking sensors rearview camera blind spot monitoring and lane keep assist. Adaptive cruise control only comes on the rangetopping Sport grade with the Level 3 equipment package. Lowergrade models with the Level 2 pack are setup for the function but it needs to be activated via a subscription. The Cooper SE in Exclusive trim requires an outlay of 36645 which could seem hefty to some however fleets will love it as company car drivers will pay 2 benefitinkind tax. Of course not all buyers are ready for pure electric driving and to broaden its appeal the Mini Cooper now the overall brand for the threedoor Mini is offered with two petrolengined options a 115PS power car the Cooper C and a sportier 150PS alternative the Cooper S. Choosing petrol lowers the entry point significantly for Mini fans. The baselevel Cooper C Classic is just 23150 and even a Cooper S Exclusive is cheaper than the starting price of the electric Mini at 29750.","2024-07-30 00:00:00","2024-08-02 18:20:53.383761"

Its used car sales that greases the wheels of motor retail and lets it all happen. Its affordable and accessible used cars that enable the majority of the population to steadily upgrade into a more modern safer lesseremitting car than they drove previously. After all for every single new car sold to a private retail buyer last year there were seven used car transactions registered by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. A dealerships healthy bottom line is reliant on success in used car sales. The complexity of used car retailing can be easily underestimated as weve seen in the failed attempts by Virgin Tesco Cazoo and others to rival the expert dealers we have in the UK. The need to keep on top of stock sourcing preparation marketing price adjustments speed of sale retained margin point of sale FampI customer experience and more means that dealers must always have one eye on the basics and the other on the opportunities around the corner.

Editors letter Manufacturers and their UK franchised dealer networks are being charged with convincing the public that electric vehicles are their future. Its no easy task as were seeing this year. Now that the early adopters have already embraced zero emissions motoring it falls to knowledgeable trusted motor retailers and their carmaker partners to win over the mainstream motorist. After all the new UK Government remains committed to reducing transport carbon emissions and the Zero Emissions Vehicle ZEVMandate sets out clear objectives for the countrys new car and van markets. Manufacturers must play the EV game well to avoid harsh penalties. In the consumers favour this is leading to discounts and finance support in retail Motability and fleet sectors that will help the considerers to see a stronger case for electric vehicle purchase. Rapid initial depreciation of EVs is bringing nearly new cars into more affordable territory too which is good news for the many motorists who are EV curious. The challenge for dealers nevertheless is to convert that curiosity into buying intention quickly enough while theres good margin in their stock. At the same time franchised dealerships are managing their own buying intentions what and where should they invest in charging facilities to meet the future needs of their own operations without blowing the budget.

Weve already expanded our product range significantly with more improvements and launches on the horizon. PatFluid is a Fuel Borne Catalyst a diesel fuel additive designed to aid the regeneration of Diesel Particulate Filters DPFs. It serves as a universal aftermarket replacement for all four generations of onboard DPF additives used in vehicles with additive dosing systems. Over the years weve seen a shift with more and more vehicles using a flexible and replaceable bag on the vehicle instead of a refillable fixed rigid additive tank. To address this change weve launched our own PatFluid Bag range starting with seven of the most common parts. We plan to expand this range to ensure comprehensive coverage providing a likeforlike replacement filled with PatFluid. Another significant change over the past fifteen years is the emergence of lowcost aftermarket Fuel Borne Catalyst products. Our tests show these alternatives have 8090 lower active material content compared to PatFluid and Original Equipment OE products. This reduced content can lead to diminished performance higher fuel consumption and increased risk of DPF blockage or damage.

The heat generated by friction must be removed quickly during braking to avoid brake fade and rapid brake pad deterioration says Juratek. Most vehicles come with straight vane discs with internal cooling vanes that extend straight from the center of the disc outward in a straight line. Some higher performance cars come with directional discs which have curved or tilted internal cooling vanes. When the discs rotate at speed centrifugal force pulls air from the center of the disc through the vents and out of the disc resulting in improved cooling efficiency. Thus there is a left and a right disc indicated in the Juratek part number with a suffix of L left or R right. When the directional discs are properly installed these internal vanes should lean toward the back of the car as shown in fig 2. The direction of any slots or drill holes on the outside of the disc see fig 1. do not indicate whether the disc should be fitted on the LH or RH side of the vehicle. Failure to install discs correctly can result in the discs becoming too hot. If the brake discs exceed the normal operating temperature hot brake judder can sometimes be the consequence. This is indicated in fig 3. It clearly shows oxidisation orange colouring soot deposits on the hub surface and blue tint to the braking surface. All of these factors are indicative of excessive temperature which can lead to distortion of the disc and cracking of the disc surface.

Complexity can overwhelm us. And in todays environment complexity and variables seem to be all around us. You cant even go into a café and order a coffee without being given a trillion options. And the variables which contribute to complexity come in many different forms including Sheer volume the number of things we are managing or the overload of information we are dealing with. Characteristics the level of complexity we are dealing with or the risk factors attached to each element Relationships Who else is involved and who else are we dependent on to deliver Where do your priorities sit in their priorities Speed timescalesurgency of the number of things you are managing. What one person considers complex another might consider standard and we all have different levels of complexity tolerance. I like the concept which compares complexity to each of us being a skilled juggler. What we sometimes fail to recognise is that even the most skilled juggler will reach the tipping point when one too many balls get added and the whole lot collapses as we veer into overwhelm. Whether we lead and manage others or lead and manage things processes projects inventory its useful to recognise our own level of complexity tolerance. So how can we better manage complexity Over the years Ive learned that as human beings we typically want a level of certainty. When we keep on being thrown new balls to juggle depending on the ball it can send us into fight flight or freeze mode. The pace of change has changed massively in the past few decades and the amount and complexity of stuff that gets thrown at us these days is very different than it was 3040 years ago. Recognising that means finding ways to focus on what counts. Whilst we cant tell you what your own complexity tolerance levels are we can share some tips on how to manage complexity 1 Be outcomes focussed. Be clear about what you are trying to achieve and why. This helps you focus your attention on whats important rather than getting bogged down in the many demands on your time. Your outcomes can be businessfocussed customerfocussed or processfocussed but make sure they are clear. 2 Be ruthless and cut through the crap. Are you the best person to be dealing with this Is this the best use of your time Where do you add most value Then create a system to deal with things e.g. Do Delegate Defer for now Dump. 3 Eat the elephant one piece at a time. Consider the Circles of Concern Influence and Control see below. Identify what elements fit in each area. This model is brilliant for its simplicity and focus and can really help you take control of the things you can actually do something about and tackle those one by one rather than getting overwhelmed by the things you cant change. 4 Ditch doing things as theyve always been done. It doesnt matter if youve always looked after a certain project or process. If its not working or if you arent the right person to do it identify where else it could sit and change things. Consider whether the thing you never get around to focusing on could be an opportunity for growth and development for someone else. 5 Create a learning culture where the focus is on flexibility improvisation creativity and failing fast then moving on. This creates an environment where team members will take things on and have a go where they will be comfortable stepping outside their comfort zone without fear of negative consequences if things dont quite go to plan. When we learn from our mistakes we grow in confidence and competence. 6 Grow more and better relationships rather than simply relying on yourself all the time. Share leadership with others in the business. So often you uncover hidden talents. Recognise that you cant possibly know and do everything so consider who can support you and how and then be creative in how you facilitate this. 7 If others are providing you with too much information or detail set expectations and be clear about what you want and need to help you. The chances are they are providing a plethora of data because they think you need it sometimes a conversation goes a long way to clarifying what both parties need with benefits on both sides. Complexity is something we all need to manage and these seven tips may help you get clearer about where to focus.

52,"https://cdn-images.am-online.com:443/thumbs/960x960/media/1/root/niche-used-cars-classic-cars.jpg","https://www.am-online.com/features-landing/return-to-normality-is-opening-up-dealers-stock-channels","Return to normality is opening up dealers stock channels","The used car market increased by 6.5 to almost two million units sold in the first quarter of 2024 according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders SMMT. It was the fifth quarter of successive growth as the second hand market hit a fiveyear high reflecting recovering supply in the new car market which in turn has improved used car availability and choice. According to Close Brothers Forecourt Foresight research which surveys more than 130 dealers almost threequarters 74 of dealers use tradeins as their primary source of stock. More than twothirds 70 use online auctions and threeinfive 60 buy vehicles from private sellers. Added to those figures 44 of dealers get their stock via other dealerships and a third 33 turns to digital platforms such as Auto Trader and Motorway. Only 21 uses inperson auctions writes Alex Wright. The bottom line is however that whichever channel they use with more stock now flowing through the market its critical that car dealers capitalise on the opportunity by finding the best vehicles possible. Auction buying Paul Hill spokesman for the National Association of Motor Auctions NAMA says the most effective channel for stock sourcing is through auctions both physical and online. Given that NAMAs members handle more than one million vehicles annually including cars and supercars they are well placed to help in that regard he claims. NAMA members are trusted sources that provide a high level of reliability and transparency which is crucial for dealers says Hill. In addition to traditional auctions online auctions have become increasingly important. The digital transformation of the auction industry has made it possible to participate in auctions from virtually anywhere. These online platforms provide realtime data and analytics helping dealers make decisions quickly. The ability to bid on vehicles remotely has streamlined the process making it more efficient and costeffective. Hill says that the key benefits of auctions are the vast choice of vehicles they provide and the ability to make instant decisions with a vehicle being sold every 45 seconds. That enables dealers to quickly fill inventory gaps without having to wait he adds. Another advantage says Hill is that the dealer pays the market price at the time of purchase because the prices arent fixed. That he says creates a dynamic and competitive environment. Vendors and buyers come together in a transparent environment ensuring that market forces determine the price says Hill. Auctions also offer a degree of protection and indemnity for vehicles through laws and permits which is a significant advantage. The flipside of an auctions competitive nature however Hill says is that it can sometimes drive prices up reducing the potential margin for resale. Therefore he says buyers need to be prepared to compete for the best prices which can be challenging when multiple bidders are interested in the same vehicle. Neil Smith founder of Motorvait says that while the primary advantages of sourcing through auction are choice and volume the fees are high often exceeding the profit that can be made on the vehicle. This feature first appeared in AMs Spotlight on Used Car Retailing report read the whole report here. He adds that it is also difficult to assess the vehicles condition especially mechanically when looking at an online catalogue. Some auctions also make it difficult to reject a vehicle giving dealers only 48 hours from receipt to report back any mechanical issues he says. A good option is to seek out those smaller more niche auctions that sit below the primary auction channels advises Smith pictured. These more niche auctions still have a reasonable volume of stock across a number of weekly sales and typically the fees charged are noticeably lower than those of their larger competitors. Cliff Deller managing director of Orchid Automotive says that for big volumes the larger car supermarkets and marketplaces such as BCA Aston Barclay and Mannheim are the best sources. They are particularly effective he says when for example a dealer wants to buy hundreds of vehicles. Online marketplaces The most effective channel according to James Wilson chief operations officer of Motorway is online marketplaces. Motorway itself regularly lists up to 1500 cars per day seven days a week giving dealers a large range of quality used car stock to bid on he says. Everything is done online from browsing and bidding for stock to making fast and secure payments using Motorway Pay offering dealers the easiest and most effective way to stock their forecourts says Wilson. Wilson pictured adds that buying stock at physical auctions takes up a significant amount of time out of the office travelling to the site and inspecting and bidding on cars. And even then you arent guaranteed to get the stock you need he says. Buying privatelyowned stock through an online marketplace like Motorway allows dealers to get exactly what they need for their forecourt says Wilson. With thousands of cars listed every week dealers are spoiled for choice with unique stock across all makes models ages and prices. Dealers also typically make more margin through online auctions buying from private sellers as opposed to traditional auctions. Occasionally private sellers may have undisclosed damage but were constantly evolving our platform to solve these instances. For example we have AI Image Assist which uses AI artificial intelligence to check photos submitted by private sellers to ensure they are of high quality and this year we launched Motorway Collect an app used by drivers to ensure there is a consistently high quality appraisal at collection. Direct from consumer Rather than auctions Smith says that buying direct from consumers is a more attractive route for retailers. The upsides are that there are no fees involved and dealers have the chance to properly assess the vehicle before agreeing a final price. This ensures they are far more in control of their initial margin and without associated fees they have more margin to play with from the outset says Smith. They are also in control of what they pay for that vehicle and if operating a retail back pricing strategy they know what the purchase price limit is based on what they can realise from a retail perspective. So unlike other channels they dont run the risk of being bid up. The main disadvantage says Smith is the logistics costs when having to pick up remotely assessed vehicles. However they are typically less than the auction fees. It also requires the buying team to know exactly what they are doing when pricing a vehicle based on a customers assessment and to carry out all the necessary due diligence before agreeing a figure. This feature was first published in AMs Spotlight on Used Car Retailing report read the full report here By due diligence I mean checking the vehicle ownership Cap HPI register for stolen vehicles vehicles with outstanding personal finance that may not be declared cloned vehicles ID and address checks and agree to only pick up from the registered address says Smith. The cost of marketing and resourcing the car buying operation also needs to be factored into the equation when making a decision as to the sourcing channels you will use. Hill says that buying directly from consumers comes with significant risks attached. Unlike auctions where theres a degree of legal protection and transparency he says that buying from consumers can be riskier. There is a greater likelihood of encountering title issues or even cloned vehicles says Hill. The process also tends to be more timeconsuming. Each transaction involves negotiating the sale which can be a lengthy process. We recommend that if you are not purchasing from auction houses it is safer to buy from reputable car dealers. Car dealers often provide warranties have conducted thorough inspections and ensure that the title is clear offering more security and peace of mind for the buyer. Deller says that part exchange is the most profitable channel of vehicle sourcing. But he added that the problem is retailers tend to undervalue their own product. The value of part exchange is that is you have serviced the vehicle know its pedigree and history have done a proper appraisal and test driven it and done any work that you need to do on it you can turn it more easily and make a good margin on it says Deller. The problem is that all too often dealers undervalue it so end up losing out on the margin that can be made. Quality of stock Hill says that there has been a noticeable improvement in the quality of used car stock available over the past 18 months. He adds that the new car supply has significantly improved thus increasing the availability of younger lowermileage used vehicles by about 20. This improvement means dealers are now dealing with better quality stock which reduces the need for extensive preparation and allows more resources to be spent on reconditioning where necessary says Hill. This not only makes the process more efficient but also helps in maintaining a higher standard of inventory ultimately benefitting both dealers and consumers. Deller says that while there is a greater choice of used cars available now many of them are in poor condition making the competition for quality vehicles more intense. Dealers will only buy the lesser ones if they are cheap he says. The market for cars in good condition with a full history and an Auto Trader rating has only intensified says Deller. Its the less good ones people dont want that tend to get ignored and left behind. While Smith says he hasnt seen any evidence that the quality of used car stock have improved in recent years preparation costs have typically increased 25 over the past three years due to higher labour rates and parts prices. Therefore he says that it is vital to work out the amount of cosmetic preparation required as well as whether the vehicle needs a service or MOT and then factor that into the purchase price. Dealers also need to include an average mechanical rectification sum and their required first published margin and to establish the current market value based on the exact make model derivative age and mileage says Smith. Only then will they know what they are prepared to pay. Rising vehicle age Wilson says the average age of used cars is also increasing as owners are holding onto them longer and putting more miles on the clock. The result he says is more preparation work for retailers. Rupert Pontin pictured head of the UK at AutoGrab says Wherever you choose to look every potential vehicle source in the sector will still have the full spectrum of both delightful and dreadful cars on offer. It is only by taking advantage of every piece of information available that wholesale buyers can be sure that the golden egg they spot is everything its cracked up to be. Consideration needs to be given to a multitude of vehicle pitfalls such as outstanding recalls previous use as a taxi purchase via a salvage sale or hidden details in their history that can only be revealed using a thorough provenance check. All these can turn that golden egg into a rotten tomato and some will inevitably lead to additional preparation time increased stocking costs and lower margins. Similarly advertising history can be a valuable indicator of a problem car. If a vehicle has been made available for retail or trade sale multiple times from different sources in the past 12 months then it is an indication that it is difficult to sell and can be a sign that something isnt quite right.","2024-07-31 00:00:00","2024-08-02 18:20:54.6836"

SMMT registration data shows that over the first half of this year private battery electric car uptake has fallen 10.8 yearonyear with fewer than one in five BEVs going to private buyers. We need to start to address the overall level of demand for EV said Gerry Keaney chief executive of the BVRLA. Some areas are stagnating and were seeing that clearly in the retail sector. We need to make those cars more affordable. We need some support programme whether its incentives reduced VAT or something else. Theres no incentive today for a retail buyer to choose an EV over an ICE vehicle. The conference looked at three issues affecting the new electric car retail market affordability education and incentives and how they can be tackled writes Andrew Ryan. Affordability The biggest barrier to a retail consumer moving to an electric car today is cost said Lakshmi Moorthy managing director of Arval UK. I firmly believe most people want to do the right thing for the planet but theyre not going to do it if its going to make them financially worse off. The conference heard the average new price of a battery electric car is 49165 compared to 37435 for an ICE car. While battery electric cars can be cheaper to fuel than ICE vehicles depending on where they are charged the cost to run one will increase from April 1 when they will be subject to a changes in vehicle excise duty. Traditionally BEVs have been in band A under the graduated VED system which is currently 0. From April 1 2025 this band is effectively being removed with BEVs moving into the first band where a rate becomes payable. This is currently for vehicles with CO2 emissions of between 1gkm and 50gkm and is 30. After the first year BEVs will be subject to the standard annual rate currently 190 which they were previously exempt from. Also from the same date new electric cars with a list price exceeding 40000 will need to pay the Expensive Car Supplement for a period of five years from the second tax payment onwards. That was designed so that premium car buyers would pay a bit more than those who bought traditional volume or value cars said Mike Hawes pictured below chief executive of the SMMT. You saw the average price of EVs the supplement sweeps up most of them. But when were thinking about these vehicles remember theyre a new technology they are more expensive to make. There is no getting away from that. Prices will come down but it will be gradual. Ian Plummer commercial director at Auto Trader told the conference the importance of cost is highlighted by his companys experiences which show there is a willing pool of buyers for EVs if the price is right. Recent research showed the Honda eNY1 emerged as Julys most soughtafter brandnew EV and the seventhmost indemand new car across all fuel types leaping from 254th place in June following substantial discounts deposit contributions and attractive finance offers. This is also true in the used car market he said. Are people interested in used EVs and is there an equation that works Yes they are and there is an equation that works. Its price parity. After increasing through and immediately after the Covid pandemic EV residual values have dropped by around 50 percentage points since August 2022 including a fall of around 25 to 30 percentage points over the past year They are now at a level where they are attractive to customers said Plummer. If youre a retailer who held a car while EVs were repriced over this period its been painful. You bought it at one value maybe sold it for less than that he added. As used EV prices fell through early 2023 days to sell dropped from 47 days to 26 days the fastest of any fuel type. Fundamentally if youre now buying and selling an EV in the used market as a retailer youve got a good opportunity to turn that car around well because you are selling it at a price point the consumer needs it to be which is parity said Plummer. Education The UK is awash with misinformation about EVs and this is negatively impacting how retail buyers think about the technology the conference heard. Myths include their susceptibility to fires and excessive battery degradation. The fact is EVs are good said Edmund King president of the Automobile Association. Quentin Willson journalist and campaigner pictured had a Tesla S model on the recent EV Rally that had done 250000 miles and the battery was 92 as good as it was when it was new. A lot of these myths about EVs just dont hold up and I do think part of the problem is linked to a lack of that correct information. Hawes added What we need to do is change the narrative. We used to frame it well we had this tremendous thing called Go Ultra Low which was a partnership between Government and industry to promote and extol the virtues of EVs to assist the transition. We need to think about something we can all do about conveying the benefits of EVs to consumers and helping them adopt the technology. Manufacturers and dealers have a major role to play in helping to overcome any concerns and misinformation to drive retail demand. We have to recognise that for the people who sell EVs to customers daytoday its actually quite a heck of a change and we need to work through some of those areas that customers are inquiring about to address their concerns said Owen Shepherd head of direct sales at Volkswagen UK. We know retail customers looking at EVs have a longer consideration time than those looking at ICE vehicles in terms of the time they want to take to make that decision. They need more intervention from the sales team to walk them through the journey so they are confident an EV is the right choice for them. To do this manufacturers should ensure retailers are up to speed with everything that goes into buying and living with an EV. Its not just a conversation about the monthly rate or the power output in comparison to an ICE vehicle etc. said Shepherd. Its a conversation around charging around the cost of ownership around charging an EV at home versus fuelling an ICE at a petrol station. Its about how we normalise BEVs in a customers mind. Thats actually a really challenging job for sales teams to do. Volkswagen has introduced a programme called Same Spirit Different Energy to educate and engage its sales teams. This is about taking the traditional spirit and the history and heritage of our brand and how it is still in existence in our new EV cars. Its just they are powered in a different way said Shepherd. We focus on their ease of use how you live with an EV the charging partnerships to really explore the benefits and savings coupled with some really competitive offers on the product. The programme includes rolling out specific EV training at each site in its retail network as well as encouraging retailers to separate their EV leads from ICE leads in recognition that they may need more interventions and will take a longer period from the initial inquiry though to sale. Incentives Speakers at the conference called for the reintroduction of Government incentives to help retail customers switch to electric cars. In the past the Government offered the Plugin Car Grant to help towards the cost of purchase of a vehicle and the Electric Vehicle Homecharge Scheme to help homeowners install a charger. EVs have also been subject to 0 VED and exempt from the Expensive Car Supplement see affordability section above. However neither of the Government grants exist anymore while the VED benefits are being removed from April 1 next year. Meanwhile company car drivers continue to be offered favourable benefitinkind tax bands for choosing BEVs and registrations of the zero emission vehicles in this sector continue to power ahead. Keaney pictured said Where there is support in place we are seeing strong sales rates of EVs and thats being driven by and powered by the company car market and salary sacrifice. Where there is support it makes a huge difference. You can then see that where there is no support the market is really struggling and were seeing that clearly in the retail sector. Shepherd added Weve seen incentives work within the fleet segment and clearly we need those to continue. Weve also seen them work in the retail segment when the plugin car grants were there and I think we need them again so we can move forward instead of the stalling in demand were seeing at present. Suggestions made at the conference for possible incentives included reducing VAT on EVs for a period of time. SMMT has previously said halving VAT on BEVs for three years for three years would reenergise the market putting an additional 300000 private BEVs rather than petrol or diesel cars on the road over the next three years on top of current outlooks.","2024-07-30 00:00:00","2024-08-02 18:20:54.74547"

Thats according to FCA chief executive Nikhil Rathi who gave an update on the progress of the finance and insurance regulators investigation into historic car loan commissions on the latest Inside FCA Podcast. The regulator has just extended the timescale of its review which was triggered by ombudsman cases regarding discretionary commission arrangements and disclosure to buyers into spring 2025. Rathi said By May next year May 2025 when we will have the opportunity to have looked at all the data understood what the courts have said as well and one of the possibilities although we havent taken a final decision yet is that we might put in place what we call a redress scheme which is a scheme that applies across the market or part of the market and allows for a consistent way to manage redress for consumers. If we go down that route that has to be consulted upon and it takes time to put together. And so on a precautionary basis we have extended a pause in complaints all the way to December 2025 but obviously if we can go quicker we absolutely will. The review is examining whether the discretionary commission arrangements that were used prior to the ban introduced by the FCA in January 2021 were operating in a way which was consistent with the law and regulation that was in place at that time. Rathi added This work has been underway now for a number of months and what we have found is that there are issues and there have been issues in this market. And what were looking at is the scale and breadth of those issues. Thats why Ive said its unlikely at the end of this that you know were going to find nothing. From the data the FCA is examining it will propose a fair route to redress for consumers whove unwittingly been victim of a breach. He said one option is to allow firms to continue to process complaints in the normal way and that might be a route we choose for some situations but now that a picture of the issue is becoming clearer it is looking more likely that some kind of structured redress mechanism may be necessary. The problem of missold payment protection insurance was resolved by a FCAimplemented compensation system which led to regulated firms paying out millions of pounds. He doesnt expect the redress for the motor finance issue to be of the same scale as the PPI scandal. Rathi was keen to emphasise that the FCA has an objective to protect consumers but also to to make sure the market functions well now and in the future so his team must also be thinking about how to ensure that any action also supports the continued supply of motor finance to millions of consumers who depend on it. Nearly 80 of households in the United Kingdom own a car so its really important that we make sure that market continues to function fairly and well in the future too he added. Asked whether he recognises the risk that some firms involved in motor finance might fail he responded that this is a really important point and added We have worked really hard to understand the financial position of different firms. Motor finance is not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme which means that if a motor finance provider goes bust and lacks enough resources to pay creditors its customers would get no redress. That was why in April the FCA wrote to firms to ask them to pay particular attention to their financial resilience. An underlying message was to preserve funds such as by not paying out large dividends to shareholders. Under FCA rules a regulated firm must always make sure its got adequate financial resources to meet its obligations to meet its liabilities. And any firm that may be thinking that it could have a redress liability coming up in the future needs to make sure that it maintains the appropriate level of funds to prepare for that liability so weve asked firms to make sure they tell us if theyre thinking of any significant distributions to their shareholders or any other way in which their funds may be dissipated he added. On the extension of the review Rathi said it has taken a bit longer than expected for firms to provide the FCA with the data that will help it understand the scale of the historic motor finance commission issue. Add to that the judicial review of one Financial Ombudsman Service ruling that is likely to be heard in the autumn and a couple of related cases in the Court of Appeal and the FCA clearly needs the extra time. Were certainly working to make sure that we have a consistent outcome efficient outcome and that were able to give some clarity as soon as we can using the legal powers available to us he added. And Ill end by saying we absolutely understand the uncertainty that this work has caused for consumers and the market and we are working really hard to make sure we can resolve these issues and give a clear path forward as soon as we can.

McClenaghan called 999 as he suffered a heart attack while in his office at the car dealership in Coatbridge North Lanarkshire in 2018 but although an ambulance arrived the paramedics left when they couldnt see him. He was later discovered by a security guard. He was aged 57. Reports found that paramedics did not get out of the ambulance when they arrived at the Kia dealership. The Scottish Ambulance Service conducted its own review following this tragic incident with all actions identified being implemented. But now Scotlands Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service COPFS has said the circumstances surrounding Mr McClenaghans death gave rise to serious public concern to justify a discretionary fatal accident inquiry FAI. The FAI will determine the cause of death the circumstances in which it occurred and to establish what if any reasonable precautions could have been taken and could be implemented in the future to minimise the risk of future deaths in similar circumstances. COPFS anticipates that the focus of the FAI will be on the circumstances surrounding the actions and response of the Scottish Ambulance Service to the emergency. Procurator Fiscal Andy Shanks who leads on fatalities investigations for COPFS said The Lord Advocate considers that the death of David McClenaghan occurred in circumstances giving rise to serious public concern and as such a discretionary fatal accident inquiry should be held. An FAI will allow a full public airing of the evidence of the procurator fiscals wider investigations with interested parties. The evidence will be tested in a public setting and be the subject of an independent judicial determination.

The fault was manmade and these can be the trickiest to solve especially when it is an electrical fault. This is because software engineers do not write software to anticipate someone manipulating circuits or changing it from how it was originally designed. The vehicle in question was a Toyota Pro Ace van more commonly recognised as a Peugeot Expert the only difference being Toyota badges. The van was originally brought in with a blown turbocharger which had failed mechanically. Once this was replaced by my colleague the van was road tested. However it had no boost and quickly went into limp home mode storing an under boost code. Returning to the workshop it was checked over and it was found that there was no vacuum to the turbo actuator. A few checks were done to make sure everything was where it should be which they were and at this point the vehicle was handed over to me to have a look. The 2.0 diesel engine fitted to this van uses a vacuum controlled waste gate actuator. The actuator itself also has a position sensor fitted and starting the vehicle showed the engine control module command to demand a position of 90. Despite this the actual position stayed at 0 confirming the complaint. I decided to first test at the control solenoid which was placed awkwardly down the back of the engine unbolting the solenoid and gaining access to the pipework allowed me to carry out some checks on this solenoid we have 3 pipes the first a vacuum supply in the second which is the vacuum output which goes to the turbo to control the waste gate and the third to atmosphere to allow the solenoid to release excess vacuum when required as with the solenoid being constantly supplied vacuum it cannot release vacuum via the turbo actuator as this would cause the turbo actuator to over boost which is not what we want. For my first check I applied vacuum to the outlet pipe to the turbo watching live data on the scan tool to make sure the pipe was ok and the turbo actuator was capable of moving. This test showed the position to move to 90 like the command from the engine ECU was asking for so my problem lay elsewhere. Next I started the engine and checked vacuum supply to the solenoid. My gauge showed a healthy vacuum of 30inHg inches of mercury and testing the last pipe showed a clear route to atmosphere. This meant my problem lay either in the solenoid itself or the control from the ECU. The solenoid is controlled using Pulse Width Modulation PWM. Please refer to Fig.1. This is where on this particular component the ECU sends a 12v supply to one side of the solenoid and as the solenoid is a effectively a coil of wire the voltage flows through it and back down the other wire to the control unit. When it wants the solenoid to operate it quickly pulses the return wire to ground over and over continuously while maintaining battery voltage on the supply side this voltage difference causes the solenoid to work and it does this at such a rate of change that it can accurately control the speed and movement of the solenoid which we refer to as the duty cycle. By doing this the solenoid can be operated at any position from 0 to effectively 100 allowing much finer control compared to how it was previously done by feeding a power and ground to a component and it was either on or off also by using PWM the current consumption of the component is much lower so lighter wiring can be using saving on production costs.Testing the solenoid Upon testing the solenoid for control it was noted there was 12v on both wires as expected. If we only had one 12v supply this can quickly identify we have an open or high resistance internally within the solenoid. As I had no fault code for the valve it showed the return wire to be intact to the control unit. This is how the ECU itself does a circuit check to set a fault code. It looks to see the supply voltage that is sent out return on the other wire to show circuit integrity. However upon starting the engine the control unit did not attempt to control the solenoid by applying a PWM signal. Testing the solenoid itself by applying power and ground to it showed that it clicked and operated so it was in working order. Why then was the control unit not attempting to control the solenoid on startup as expected It was at this point I decided to step back and reevaluate things and go through what could possibly cause the issue. We could have an input issue stopping the ECU from commanding the solenoid or an internal fault in the ECU. But what about the possibility of the connector for the turbo actuator solenoid being connected to the wrong component Using wiring diagrams I could check to see if the wiring colours match on my vehicle which would prove it. Carrying out a visual inspection I noticed a solenoid close by which was identical to the one I had been testing there was now a high chance we had a mismatch and the wrong connector was on the wrong solenoid. This would explain the lack of control and also why no other fault codes were stored as with both solenoids working and connected there was no reason for a fault code to be stored. After consulting wiring diagrams and wiring colours I did indeed have an issue. The other solenoid was for the EGR bypass exchanger and the wiring colours matched the plug on the solenoid I had been testing. Disconnecting my connector on the turbo actuator solenoid and reading fault codes I confirmed it was indeed the EGR circuit. Please refer to Fig.2. I then disconnected the EGR solenoid and reread codes which now logged an open circuit turbo actuator fault. Please refer to Fig.3. I then reconnected the wiring connectors onto the correct solenoids and retested the system. Now on engine start up the solenoid for the turbo control applied vacuum to the turbo itself which could be seen monitoring live data for the demanded and actual position of the turbocharger waste gate. Please refer to Fig.4 Road testing showed the vehicle could now create boost and have the getupandgo you would expect from a turbocharged engine. Returning to the workshop and rescanning for fault codes showed no fault codes present so the issue had been rectified. Why the plugs were swapped over is anyones guess. As the connectors were identical they fit either way. I can only presume someone previously doing work mixed them up by accident. On this vehicle as I knew how the solenoid operated I did not choose to refer to technical information early on in the process. In hindsight this may have led me to the issue quicker. If I had seen what the wiring colours were for each wire on the solenoid I would have spotted the issue. Even so in total the job took less time than it took for me to write this article. Like I always say following a solid process and thinking logically and methodically will always lead you to the cause of the fault.

The profession is changing bringing ever greater demands but also new incentives. The spread of emobility and the resulting transformation of the automotive industry is eliminating certain services but it is also creating new opportunities. If garage owners and operators can embrace this transformation they have the chance to become a onestop shop for all emobility services. This is a tough challenge but it is also a great business opportunity. In this article we explore the changing landscape the skills needed to thrive in this new era and how Juice Technology can seamlessly integrate emobility into a garages daily business.Less maintenance more business While its true that electric cars require less routine workshop maintenance than conventional cars carrelated services will still be essential. With batteryelectric drives there is no longer any need for exhaust checks and oil changes. Similarly changing spark plugs and filters and overhauling injectors will also be a thing of the past. In the future servicing will focus primarily on seasonal tyre changes cleaning and tuning work. Garages therefore need to start thinking about new business opportunities such as consulting purchasing advice and sales. Electromobility opens up opportunities that go beyond the usual repair and maintenance services. After buying an ecar the customers most important questions are How do I charge the vehicle How fast can I charge the vehicle and what do I do when Im on the go And it is precisely these needs that garage owners can put to good use.New skills for a changing profession As the automotive industry transforms the aftermarket sector is also changing from garages to dealers. The operators who successfully ride the wave will be those who are able to adapt to customers changing mobility habits. Adapting requires garages to acquire new skills including management and marketing skills but also specialised technical skills in electric vehicle EV diagnostics battery maintenance and high voltage systems. It will be very important for garage managers and operators to gain experience with advanced electronics and software. Equally important is deepening your knowledge of charging infrastructure. With more electric vehicles on the road the demand for charging points will increase accordingly. Garage owners and operators can take advantage of this growing sector by offering stateoftheart futureproof charging solutions at their sites.Investing in charging solutions to attract new customers Charging infrastructure must become an integral part of any garage both for onsite use and for sale. Given the variety of equipment in circulation working with an experienced partner is a good way to improve the services you offer. As a manufacturer of charging stations and a world leader in the development of portable chargers we can offer a complete range of solutions designed to meet the diverse needs of both domestic and commercial customers explained Andrew Oakes Director of Juice UK and Ireland. By adding charging solutions to their portfolio workshop operators will be able to meet the changing needs of electric vehicle owners build customer loyalty and increase revenue streams. Offering easytouse and affordable charging solutions will win the trust of potential new customers and alleviate their fear of running out of power. The best way for workshop operators to achieve this is to promote portable solutions that make charging while travelling as easy as charging at home. The great advantage of offering portable solutions is that they do not need to be installed by an installer but rather can be plugged directly into any wall socket providing a fully equipped wall charger wherever you need it. Portable chargers such as the Juice Booster 2 a threeinone device that supports charging at home at public charging points and on the go offer maximum flexibility along with maximum safety. They are as easy to use as the emergency charger cables that usually come with electric cars but they offer more power and many more safety features such as temperature monitoring. In fact special adapters mean that they can be used not only with any standard household socket but also with industrial or camping sockets.From garages to multiservice companies Garages that want to succeed in this new era should strive to become customers first point of contact for all services related to electric cars. In addition to offering technical expertise they need to be able to provide a range of useful services such as tailored charging solutions insurance and financial products specifically designed for electric vehicles. Finding installers for photovoltaic systems and suggesting the right vehicle for companies and private individuals will also be beneficial. By offering these services garages will become true hubs for a range of specialised services handling everything from orientation and networking to sales. Achieving this vision will require a holistic approach to garage services with the ultimate aim of becoming a highly specialised competence centre for electric vehicles.

The problem We have a 2019 Suzuki Ignis in for service and the customer has mentioned that the car has a jerky clutch operation and also an abnormal noise when the clutch pedal is depressed or released. We have lubricated the moving parts of the clutch pedal assembly but the clutch operation is still jerky and the noise still persists. Have other Ignis owners reported this fault before What does Autodata recommend Yes the jerky clutch operation you have described has been reported to us before by other Ignis owners. The issue is due to insufficient lubrication of the clutch release lever. Start by removing the clutch cable from the clutch release lever. Then thoroughly clean the clutch release lever and clutch cable ball joint contact surfaces. Apply grease to contact surface of clutch release lever and then fit the clutch cable to the clutch release lever. Ensure clutch cable is correctly adjusted before operating the clutch pedal to ensure the fault has been correctly rectified.

Remedies are not necessarily an award that have a monetary value attached to them.DeadlockDespite the best efforts of a business to resolve the complaint to a consumers full satisfaction stalemate may be reached where solutions offered are not viable in the eyes of the customer.This is where Alternative Dispute Resolution ADR comes into play as businesses are legally required to signpost a customer to an ADR provider.One major advantage of accreditation to The Motor Ombudsmans Motor Industry Code of Practice for Service and Repair is that in the event of deadlock garages are able to refer customers to The Motor Ombudsmans inhouse and automotivespecific dispute resolution service for help bringing a complaint to a close from a fair independent and impartial perspective.This avoids having to resort to often costly and timeconsuming legal recourse as the next port of call giving a business and a consumer the best opportunity to move forwards based on a completely unbiased outcome that has been derived from evidence provided by both parties.

Today we take ABS for granted as it is standard on most vehicles worldwide. ADAS technology has evolved over time and regulations have also changed. Recently an EU directive made ADAS systems mandatory on all cars from mid2022. This means that garages will see more faults on these systems and an increased potential for calibrations and repairs leading to more sales opportunities for their business. Repairers of all sizes are investing in tools and training to ensure they can do the work and futureproof their business. We are now nearly two years down the line and seeing this trend continue. ADAS technology is driving us towards fully autonomous vehicles but were not there yet. Currently were at the semiautonomous stage which means we can drive handsfree. Fords BlueCruise system available in the Mustang MachE electric car achieves this through a combination of traditional sensors and cameras that keep the car in its lane and at the right speed as well as a driver monitoring system that ensures the driver is paying attention. If the driver looks away an alert sounds to bring their focus back to the road. These systems are seamlessly integrated into the cars panels windscreen and dashboard making them compact and unobtrusive. In 2024 technology will continue to evolve with the adoption of LIDAR systems in production vehicles such as the new Lotus Eletre. Before this development LIDAR was considered bulky and cumbersome as seen on autonomous vehicles with large equipment on their roofs. However with LIDAR integrated into the roof and side panels of the Lotus it is now so compact that the vehicle is covered from all angles. This ensures the safety of not just the driver but also other road users. Moreover the use of LIDAR enables higher accuracy and hazard recognition. It can also register the colour and size of the obstacles. This feature allows engineers to extract data from the vehicle and program it to perform specific actions when it encounters certain objects. This becomes increasingly important as we move towards more autonomous settings in vehicles. As car manufacturers progress towards autonomous driving the technology used in ADAS will continue to develop. This means that technicians working on these vehicles need to have a thorough understanding of the technology involved as well as the necessary skills and qualifications from organisations such as the IMI to ensure that calibrations are done correctly the first time.

The new website is a quarter of the cost we were paying previously and the changeover was quick and easy.Bosch recommended GSO to us and I cant fault them.We got our first website over 24 years ago so we know how important they are even for a busy garage. I wasnt unhappy with the look of the previous site but we needed to rethink the type of work it was attracting.Lucrative jobsOur lead time had crept up to four weeks which wasnt great for customers. The website was attracting too much lowprofit work things like timeconsuming engine problems. We were struggling to fit in the quick turnaround work such as a basic service or MOT so something needed to change.GSO built the website following its established process starting with a briefing call that minimised the time and input required from Cutting. The new website was then built to organically target highprofit work the lucrative jobs that make up an ideal days work for Walker Cutting.GSO managing director Jim Lang said it is tempting to set up a website to attract every single service you offer but that doesnt address the problem of creating a new channel of enquiries that only generates profitable work.Most garages who approach us are already busy. They come to a point where they realise they need a way to attract and filter the work they really want. We approach all our builds with this mindset working with customers to ensure theyre getting the ideal work.Many garages shy away from investing in and improving their online presence. They think a website will bring in more work than they can cope with when in fact the opposite is true. Its a gatekeeper and can become invaluable to their business.Cutting added We still get a few calls for the jobs we dont want but thatll take time because were such an established garage. The difference is we now have the confidence to say no.

A garage may feel its only option is to take the vehicle to a main dealer but this can easily add a week or two onto what should be a fiveminute job.Were changing the game for garages and bodyshops by working with them to make jobs that once took days take minutes.Molloy cited the case of Leo Jayawardena at Ansam Autocentre an independent garage in Croydon who reported a diagnostic scan carried out on a Peugeot 3008 after a problem was reported with its lane assist system.The total interaction time with A1 for the resulting job was just 30 minutes. The alternative would have been for the vehicle to spend a week or more at a Peugeot main dealer according to Molloy.I estimate the garages profit margin on the job was increased by around 50. By dramatically reducing the keytokey time the customers invoice was cleared earlier too.Its vital that workshops have access to a combination of services such as ours.

However he said ramping up apprenticeships in the garage sector would take time.We cannot expect this new organisation to be able to immediately correct decades of drift on the skills front said Singh whose agency specialises in helping UK garages and automotive businesses hire highquality overseas talent.Starmer said Skills England will be set up in phases over the next year. The new body will replace the existing Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education.Education secretary Bridget Phillipson said the move was needed because the existing skills system is fragmented and broken.New generationOnce set up Skills England will work alongside the Migration Advisory Committee to identify where skills are required to cut down on the need to bring in overseas workers.However Singh said There needs to be a range of recruitment options available. Garages are increasingly looking overseas to fill technician roles for the simple reason that there are not enough mechanics available in the UK.He cited Institute of the Motor Industry figures indicating that the automotive sector faces a 160000 staff shortfall by 2030 with many of these being vehicle technicians.It will take a long time to nurture a new generation of technicians and until the apprenticeship system is functioning properly again garages will need to source some staff from overseas.Singhs comments came just days after he called on the government to add mechanics to the official list of skilled jobs deemed in short supply in the UK.

Ah the delightful symphony of an M70 engines running faults It seems the universe has bestowed upon me a generous dose of these conundrums lately as if my destiny is intertwined with the miseries of these engines. If youve been following my escapades youll remember the 635 CSI from the previous issue a real charmer of a headache. Well brace yourself because the latest episode in my automotive soap opera features the same M70 engine but this time in a vehicle that can only be described as an avantgarde masterpiece of questionable modifications. From the EML we managed to retrieve the following code 1216 Throttle potentiometer Picture this a canvas of dirt brown Hammerite paint generously splattered across the engine bay a truly artistic choice if by artistic we mean a crime against aesthetics. But lets not forget the throttle bodies also graced by the same captivating hue a colour that surely had da Vinci rolling in his grave. Of course I jest E32 owners behaviour Customers those unpredictable creatures can often succumb to the boredominduced madness that leads them to commit vehicular atrocities. Yet in our infinite wisdom we must resist the urge to judge too harshly for they are the benefactors of our livelihoods they do after all pay our salaries. Now lets talk about the peculiar habits of E32 owners. Either they as the 635 owner does look after and pamper their classics and no expense is considered too extravagant. Often these types will try to keep as much originality as possible I love these types of customers. And then I say as I take a very deep breath there are those other types. It is they who have a tendency to shower their ageing steeds with ludicrous amounts of money transforming them into rolling monuments of revolting extravagance. Massive alloy wheels a fiberglass bonnet adorned with Japanese 90s style vents on a classic 7 series yes you read that correctly. But I digress lets not dwell on the eccentricities. What baffles the mind however is the neglect of the engines vital components. While they splurge on the superficial the heart of the beast is left to wither. Consider if you will the throttle body a critical player in any engine bay. Inside resides a component with a penchant for drama itself utilising those infamous sharp encoder wipers that gleefully carve into the resistive track on the circuit board encoder. Its through this constant varying resistance that the EML the forebear to the DME deciphers the throttles every move. Yet as fate would have it these systems have a flaw. The coating wears off and suddenly the resistance values embark on a tumultuous journey resulting in a spectacle of erratic running that would make a circus seem orderly. BMW is not alone in this tragedy even Maserati suffered a similar fate. Fear not Maserati owners for a remedy exists a hall sensorbased system a beacon of hope for those plagued by throttle tribulations. As for whether such a system can be retrofitted to the venerable M70 engines throttles I remain in the dark hopeful for a solution to emerge from the murky depths of automotive innovation. Wouldnt it be a splendid twist in this tale of automotive woes Only time will tell. The initial step in this throttlebased odyssey was to seek out some data specifically resistance values that would grant both myself and my youthful accomplice Erik the ability to perform a simple yet illuminating comparison of the throttles in both their open and closed positions against a list of values. Astonishingly BMW left us high and dry in the AIR platform as data was scarce to say the least when dealing with this vintage classic leading us back to the reliable arms of our trusty friend Google. Cracking the vehicle In the vast expanse of nonsense spam and downright dodgy websites we finally stumbled upon a trove of data that promptly pointed out the glaring issue the throttle wiper was in colloquial terms thoroughly goosed. Armed with the determination to gather some hard evidence we angrily chipped away the Hammerite coating from the throttle casing set screws revealing the inner workings of this old school marvel. As the casing was split open a surprise awaited us the carbon brushes surrounding the motor collector were in pristine condition. Alas the same could not be proclaimed for the state of the carbon track Fig.1. At first glance it appeared passable but armed with a magnifying lens and the piercing light of an LED the true horror was laid bareit was utterly and completely unserviceable there would be no quick squirt of WD40 to fix this. The intricacies revealed by this microscopic investigation painted a picture of wear and tear that escaped the naked eye a tale of degradation that only magnification and illumination could uncover and of course the fault finding with the KPS multimeter Fig.2amp3. Swiftly armed with the diagnosis I embarked on the quest to procure a pristine new throttle a delightful component that came with a price tag of over 1000 euros. Naturally this revelation didnt sit well with our resident car modifier who in a grand display of dissent proclaimed I will source my own because that is far too much money. My attempts at reason akin to a lone voice in the wind echoed with protestations such as the used one may be even worse. You are wasting time and money. Alas my words fell upon deaf ears as the determined car modifier marched forth with his plan heedless of my wellintentioned counsel. Such is the mind of the customer at times. Replacing the throttle A week went by and the new throttle arrived. Erik wasted no time in popping it on to the right bank and in no time the engine was up and running again this time unsurprisingly running even worse. Erik being the young chap that he is wanted to check the throttle with a resistance measurement a request that I gladly fulfilled by grabbing my KPS meter from my faultfinding cupboard Fig.4. Sadly as suspected the new throttle was about as much use as a chocolate fireplace poker and it was swiftly taken off and plonked back where it belonged the front desk. The intention was to call our customer and finally convince him that the only way this vehicle will get back on the road is if a properly working throttle is bought and fitted. For warranty reasons we were unable to open the casing and inspect the donor throttle but lets be honest the same sort of track faults will be present if anyone ever bothers to open it up. How can I sum up this story Well if I had a pound each time that a customer dictated a diagnosis process then I would be considerably richer than I am at present. As fault finders we must constantly tread the fine balance of doing the job right and doing the job that the customer wants us to do even if they are informed as best as we possibly can. It is at times incredibly frustrating but this is the nature of our industry. Until next time I hope that this case study has motivated those reading it to place ones frustrations to the back of ones mind. We cant fix everything including customers.

When launched the Jeep Grand Cherokee WK model was reported to have good offroad capabilities and an excellent tow capacity accordingly many owners use their vehicles for this purpose. The focus of this article is a vehicle that had covered over 200000 miles. It was reported that a droning noise could be heard while driving which increased under load and during cornering. After an initial road test and inspection to confirm the symptoms the noise was identified as coming from the right rear wheel bearing which would require replacement. The preassembled febi wheel bearing kit 172491 was chosen for this repair. This comes complete with wheel and axle studs and the bearing is preloaded and greased ready for assembly to the vehicle Fig.1. Note Parts were inspected for any unusual wear and the security of the linings were checked as these are prone to detaching from the metal part of the shoe. These should be replaced as necessary. First the wheel was removed followed by the brake caliper assembly. This was then supported as a means of avoiding excess strain on the brake hose. Then the brake disc was removed. This revealed the parking brake shoes which needed to be removed. All the springs and fixings along with the brake shoes were then removed and all the positions were noted for ease of reassembly. The handbrake actuator lever was removed from the cable inspected and checked for excess corrosion and freeness of operation Fig.2. With all the brake components removed the four retaining nuts that retain the bearing assembly to the axle were unbolted. The bearing assembly then came away leaving the ABS wheel speed sensor in place Fig.3. However the brake shoe backing plate and brake caliper carrier remained attached. In some instances there is also a possibility that the half shaft also remains attached which then requires sliding out of the bearing and reinserting back into the differential in the axle. While working on a bench the caliper carrier and back plate were carefully prised apart from the original bearing assembly and inspected for damage and all mating surfaces were cleaned. Once all the parts were ready for assembly they were fitted to the new bearing assembly along with the O ring seal positioned in the retaining groove on the bearing Fig.4. Note Failure to fit the O ring can cause axle oil to leak past the bearing affecting the brake shoe linings. The mating surface of the axle was cleaned and the new bearing assembly was inserted onto the drive shaft and the axle housing. It was ensured that the parking brake cable was fitted through the back plate. With the bearing in place the four retaining nuts were tightened. The parking brake shoes were reassembled along with the actuator and a suitable brake grease was applied at any necessary contact points between the shoes and back plate. The brake disc and the brake caliper were cleaned and reassembled. Then the foot brake and parking brake were applied several times to check operation. Then the wheel was refitted. Finally the fine adjustment of the parking brake shoes was carried out. Note If any adjustment is required remove the plug from the access hole in the brake back plate Fig.5. Then loosen the parking brake cable adjustment nut until there is slack. A suitable adjusting tool should be inserted through the back plate access hole to engage a tool in the teeth of the adjusting wheel. Rotate the adjuster until a slight drag can be felt when the road wheel is rotated. Push and hold the adjuster lever away from the adjuster wheel with a thin screwdriver. Back off the adjuster until the brake drag is eliminated. Repeat adjustment on the opposite wheel and refit the plug. Adjust parking brake cable and lower vehicle. Operate both the parking brake and foot brake to make sure they hold the vehicle stationary. Release the parking brake lever and road test.

Ah the infuriating encounters we car mechanics endure. A situation so disheartening it makes one hesitate to even embark on the repair journey. All we desire is to smoothly slide those car keys back to the eagerly waiting customer across the grotty laminated service counter. This my friends is what we term in the trade the butchered effect. Picture this a wellmeaning somebody or an establishment parading as a BMW specialist repair centre plunges into the challenge with all the sincerity of a saint. Yet their efforts barely scratch the surface a mere 20 per cent commitment to a quality repair. Sometimes one cant help but feel they should step aside and leave it to the seasoned professionals perhaps dare I say someone like myself Now lets shift gears to the star of this months spectacle a 2001 M5 flaunting the remarkable S62 V8. This powerhouse when hitting the right notes belts out over 400 horsepower effortlessly delivering that brute force to the tarmac. Its akin to a Black Widows catapult launching a rosebud into Mr. Smiths unsuspecting living room window a nostalgic mischief I in my youth may have been a tad too familiar with. The business end. The glorious S62 V8 Butchered a fitting term as our M5 owner poured forth a saga dedicating over half an hour of partially incoherent babble to unravel the tangled web of what had and had not been attempted. It unfolded as a torrid affair enough to make a grown man weak at the knees. As I bravely popped the bonnet a cacophony of wiring harnesses greeted me their grotesque aged hardness akin to arteries in dire need of a triple bypass making even the toughest carotid seem pliable. A profound sigh escaped my lips this my friends was shaping up to be a colossal pain in the bottom Fig.1. When faced with the Herculean task of unveiling the mysteries concealed within the timing covers and dismantling the intricate VANOS system the first order of business was to decipher the fault codes and oh boy were there plenty. The primary culprits included the ominous failure of Bank 2 VANOS in the pressure hold test hinting at an internal leak undoubtedly a result of battleworn piston seals within the VANOS hydraulic units. Additionally there lurked a perplexing issue on Bank 1 with the exhaust camshaft timing. Swiftly a decision was reached to extract the hydraulic units from both Bank 1 and 2 paving the way for the installation of Beisan Systems seals. These little wonders neatly packed in a convenient pouch house an array of orings and the notorious Teflon seals infamous for their elusive snug fit onto the sliding pistons. These pistons propel the spiralled VANOS gear in and out which takes care of advancing or retarding the camshafts independently of the chaindriven sprockets. The soul of the S62 and what a sight it is. A masterpiece of engineering if more than a little neglected Gaining access The dismantling journey akin to moving a mountain of parts presented its fair share of challenges with the lower rear securing bolt on the timing covers proving to be a formidable adversary. However amidst the struggle a curious revelation unfolded. The Bank 1 exhaust VANOS sprocket looked like it had had a spa day recently totally different in colour compared to the other three ancientlooking sprockets that seemed as old as the car itself. Makes you wonder did they slap in that VANOS sprocket properly Especially the diaphragm spring inside the heart of the assembly Fig.2. Rebuilding a hydraulic unit might sound like a walk in the park but when it comes to the S62 its like navigating a minefield with a finetooth comb. The S62 demands the kind of care and attention reserved for delicate surgery given the myriad ways things can go spectacularly Pete Tong. And oh boy in this case the previous butchers had gone fullblown Pete Tong a fact I discovered when I yanked off the VANOS wheels. Heres the kicker they did a grand job replacing the Bank exhaust 1 sprocket and slapping in a beefier diaphragm spring. Cheers to that However after that they threw caution to the wind and forgot a crucial detail. The intake camshaft was doing a little skiptomy lou thanks to the absence of the newer more robustly engineered spring diaphragm to the VANOS sprocket. What does that mean Well its a recipe for disaster. The camshaft decides to play the timing roulette because the spring tension is slacker than it should be failing to keep it in sync with the sprocket. Basic stuff yet here we are. A thin and worn out diaphragm spring A. The newer B types are thicker and must be inserted in the opposite orientation With determination and the thought that I had got this far I took on the task of replacing all the diaphragm springs even replacing the exhaust sprocket diaphragm spring on Bank 1 just in case Fig.3. As I pieced everything together and cranked the engine over four times a satisfied grin spread across my face. The timing marks aligned with the precision of a military drill. Now it was time to set my sights on the VANOS hydraulic units. The VANOS solenoid pack from Bank 1. Note the replaced yellow wire in the top right. Straight into the battlefield and what do I spot first A scene of wiring chaos around the solenoid pack on Bank 1 Fig.4. Oh yes the previous contenders had the finesse of a bull in a china shop damaging the delicate wiring to several solenoids. All this requires the precision of a watchmaker not that of a demented screwdriverwielding chimpanzee. Prior to replacement Left with no choice I rolled up my sleeves grabbed my soldering iron and embarked on a mission to desolder and replace the wreckage they left behind. A reminder that sometimes delicate hands are needed in this line of work Fig.5. With the solenoid pack back in action it was time for an Oring and Teflon seal finger nail wrecking session. Each piston got its dose of tender loving care as I meticulously ensured a snug fit. Reassembling these components back into the car became a hunt for the sweet spots on the spiralled gears all four of them. For a more detailed guide on this crucial step swing by my YouTube channel WWW.RDR.LINKABI007. Now why is this so pivotal you may wonder Well let me spill the beans. Messing up this delicate operation means the VANOS advance and retard sweep go haywire triggering a fault code that illuminates the E39s most dreaded light the MIL. And nobody wants to deal with the MIL its like the cars way of saying you had one job and you blew it. With everything back in place all that remained was to fire up this bad boy and take it down the road for a good old thrashing. Well at least that was the plan until I remembered were in Finland the land of massive speeding fines and downright miserable weather. During this time of year it meant dealing with godawful icedup roads and no way at all to get the power down. Gutted. Maintaining an organised layout is key when working on such complex engines Still I managed to give the old V8 a good run pushing it up to 6000 rpm and boy did it sound incredible. Back in the workshop with not a fault code in sight I parked the old M5 outside overnight. The real test came with a lovely 20C cold start a challenge it passed with flying colours Fig.6. The customer swung by to pick up the car and after all this youd expect sheer bliss and gratitude right Well not really. This owner like many others has never picked up so much as an oily rag in his life let alone a spanner. The intricacies of how VANOS works Forget it What did I get for my hard work The usual moaning about the cost. Sometimes I wonder why we bother at all but then again we do get nicer customers and that makes it all alright Until next time keep spannering.

In this instalment we are investigating the diagnosis tab and mastering actuator tests. In this instalment we are delving into the mastering diagnosis actuators. Under the diagnosis tab you will find several test steps that can be particularly useful in a fault diagnosis situation. Take the actuator test function. If you are faced with an engine fault where the engine will not run to allow you to analyse the data this function can help you quickly and easily bypass the issue Fig.1. By allowing you to send a direct command to a specific component or circuit without requiring the engine to start you can quickly and easily assess whether there is an issue with the performance or function of that specific component. For example if you suspect there is an issue with the engine cooling fan you can use the actuator test to command the fan to operate directly without having to wait for the engine to reach the required temperature. If it then doesnt work you have saved valuable time and can quickly progress to further tests to the fan itself. It also enables you to be far more confident in your diagnosis as you can be certain that the fan is not functioning rather than the engine simply not reaching a temperature that would require it to cut in. As youre in control of the test you can check the operation of a component when youre expecting it to happen. Depending on what the vehicle you are working on supports you can use these actuator tests to check many other systems from an EGR valve in the engine management system to a headlamp bulb or an electric window regulator in a door control ECU. Your diagnostic process When faultfinding the result of an actuator test can help your diagnostic process and decision making by revealing whether the fault may be on the input or output side of the circuits ECU. You can also simultaneously set up an oscilloscope andor current clamp to measure the voltage and amps in the circuit when the component operates while the vehicle is static in the workshop something that might not be practical while driving on a road test. The Bosch KTS 590 has a builtin two channel oscilloscopemultimeter in the VCI which we will cover in a later article. For indepth advanced system and component testing we recommend the FSA 500 engine analyser that works in unison with ESItronic 2.0 Fig.2. A particularly useful addition where parallel testing is required. Remember sometimes there are certain preconditions required for an actuator test to be performed successfully and you must always follow the onscreen instructions to ensure the test doesnt fail Fig.3a amp 3b. Its also worth bearing in mind that if the engine is not going to be run during the test a good battery voltage is absolutely essential. We recommend that a battery support unit like the Bosch BAT 645 690 or 6120 is used. Reporting function On most vehicle systems you can pick and choose the components you want to actuate by selecting them from a list Fig.4. Some vehicles offer a predetermined output test sequence which will operate the supported items one by one a routine defined and designed by the manufacturer. Most actuator tests will automatically show some relevant actual values together with the actuation process on screen to give you further evidence of the effectiveness of the test. This is beneficial when you cant physically see or hear the component that youre testing such as the heated seat element. If you would prefer you can also use the F7 list soft key to choose your own values to be displayed during the test. Once the test is complete you have the option to confirm if the test was activated or not. If you click Yes then a symbol will appear before that actuator name to indicate that it is activated Fig.5. Pressing F4 when youre finished will add the actuator results to the protocol report. You can then print off the results to show your customer as evidence of which components were tested. Follow the steps Your next option on the main test steps selection list is the function tests option. These diagnostic routines use a specific test plan to determine the operation state of a component or system. For instance you will see braking tests for Bosch ABSESP systems that are best performed on a roller brake tester. Other function tests could be available such as cylinder balancing or a systems output selftest. These can aid in fault finding work and later confirming a repair to the vehicle. Next adjustments settings are diagnostic procedures where stored values can be reset or changed within the control unit. For example this could be a service lamp reset or component adaptations or fuel quantity adjustment if a new diesel injector has been fitted TPMS coding if a tyre pressure sensor has been replaced or even rainlight sensor adaptation if the windscreen has been renewed. A full selection of further options will be available for you to work through if required Fig.6. Finally you can add information such as customer and vehicle reference to later identify the job associated with the file. The actual value display features can be useful in diagnostics by allowing you to view and store the data from the vehicle in different ways. Dont forget certain routines will only work if the set preconditions are followed Fig.7. In the ESItronic 2.0 function tests adjustmentsettings and special functions the preconditions are always stated in the information text screens that precede the start of the routine. If the KTS detects that the preconditions are not met it will delay the start of the test and display on screen any values that are outside of the expected range. Next instalment well be using the builtin multimeter or oscilloscope functions included in the KTS vehicle communication interface.

However there are also car owners who choose to remove the vehicles air suspension system and convert to traditional coil spring suspension. What could be the reason behind this choice In this article Arnott will explain what the advantages and disadvantages are of converting a vehicle from air to coil suspension. While air suspension provides a smooth ride and load levelling there are reasons why car owners prefer to remove their air suspension systems. The main drivers for this decision are usually cost of ownership and usage. For ageing vehicles especially the value of the vehicle and expected remaining time of ownership can play a key role in making the decision to install a coil conversion kit instead of repairing air suspension system defects. Sometimes converting to coil springs is simply the least expensive option. Another reason to go for a coil conversion kit could be that the vehicle is going to be used in long road trips safaris or similar expedition trips where there is extreme weather or little possibility of an air suspension repair along the way. Converting from air to coil can be a viable option at that point because it eliminates rubber components and uses traditional steel coil springs in the suspension instead. Disadvantages of conversion Losing the beneficial characteristics of air suspension additional safety stability and comfort are clearly the biggest disadvantages of converting a vehicle from air to coil spring suspension. Customers who tow larger trailers or often carry large loads are advised to keep the air suspension system to maintain the benefit of the automatic autoleveling functionality. Coil springs are designed to provide an excellent ride within certain boundaries. If a converted car carries heavy load the springs will sag. Consequentially the reduced suspension travel will affect the driving comfort harsher ride possibility of bottoming out the balance of the car and the reaction of the vehicle to steering inputs. Additionally it affects wheel alignment eventually causing irregular tyre tread wear. Coil conversion kits For older vehicles or those with a multitude of air suspension system issues Arnott offers coil spring conversion kits designed to replace a vehicles failing air suspension components with traditional steel coil springs and matching struts andor shocks. All of the companys coil springs conversion kits are made in the USA and are designed and roadtested to provide a smooth ride along with many years of troublefree driving. These kits can be installed without special modifications to the vehicle. Many of Arnotts kits include an electronic bypass module EBM which is designed to eliminate suspension dashboard warning lightsfault codes.

Legal experts MILS assisted Motus Group after Group Lotus filed a complaint due to the one letter difference between the two company names. Lotus objected to Motus Groups own trademarks and demanded that the company name be changed to differentiate between the two corporate bodies. The dispute went all the way to the Intellectual Property Tribunal where the case was heard on August 30 2023. Lotus chose to appeal after losing the initial case and continued to argue that the marks were so similar that members of the public would still confuse the goods and services provided by Motus with those provided by Lotus. After a further hearing MILS was again successful in defending Motus position and protecting both its trademarks and corporate identity. Motus won on all counts so much so that MILS has restricted Group Lotus existing trademarks some of which have been in place since 1957 from protections against all land vehicles to motor cars only.

New EVs are commonly more expensive than the closest petrol and diesel equivalents however used EV values have fallen sharply in the past two years to provide motorists with a bargain. On average values of used EVs for cars at the same age and mileage point have halved in value since September 2022. For models such as the Jaguar iPace Mercedes EQC and Tesla Model X this can equate to well over 20000 less than in the summer of 2022 and for cars like the Porsche Taycan up to 40000 less making previously unobtainable cars a real option for more consumers. Chris Plumb EV specialist at Cap HPI said The growing availability of secondhand electric models is driving demand as motorists want to reduce their environmental footprint and make significant motoring cost savings due to high diesel and petrol prices. In May 2024 17.6 of all new car registrations were electric cars with 26031 new electric cars registered. Sales of used electric cars were 71 higher in the first quarter of 2024 than in the same period last year and sales of used hybrids are also increasing significantly. More than 41500 pure electric cars were sold on the used market in the first quarter of this year alone. While Cap HPI has highlighted here that used EVs are representing great value for consumers it has also said the rate of decline in prices is slowing with just a 1 drop in July being the strongest month so far this year.","2024-08-07 00:00:00","2024-08-08 13:07:12.044231"

The overall increase represents the sixth consecutive quarter increase for used car sales in the UK and saw an additional 131128 vehicles sold compared with the same period in 2023. Transactions have risen in every month of the year with the first six months up 6.8 to 3931318 units marking the best growth since 2016 and the best first half since 2019. Yeartodate the market is now just 3 below prepandemic levels. Used EVs secure highest ever UK market share Increasing numbers of used car buyers are switching to battery electric vehicles BEVs with 46773 finding new owners between April and June. Its the highest ever market share for used EVs at 2.4 up from 1.7 in the same period last year. While the overall market is clearly still dominated by more traditional fuel types its an indicator of the direction of travel as used EV sales continue to grow from a small base. Sales of plugin hybrids PHEVs and hybrids HEVs also grew up 25.2 to 21580 units and 43.6 to 78782 units respectively. Petrol and diesel powered cars still accounted for 92.4 of all vehicles down from 94.3 last year. Petrol remained the most popular fuel type up 9.2 while diesel fell by 1.2.

Superminis still the most popular used segment Superminis sustained their position as the bestselling used vehicle type with volumes increasing by 8.6 to make up 31.9 of transactions followed by lower medium 27.1 share and dual purpose 15.8 share. The Ford Fiesta which has now be discontinued for new car sales led used car sales in Q2 with 77236 units sold. The top three accounted for three quarters of all used vehicles with only the executive 4.2 and luxury saloon segments 5.4 recording volume falls. Black remained the most popular used car colour recording 6.3 growth and accounting for more than one in five 21.2 transactions. Unchanged from last year grey and blue took second and third places with 17.5 and 16.3 market shares respectively. White moved into fourth place to push silver back to fifth while creamivory remained at the bottom end of the spectrum at just 1194 units. Mike Hawes SMMT chief executive said Its encouraging to see the used car market continue its recovery with choice and affordability rejuvenated by the new car sectors sustained run of growth. The increased supply of electric vehicles to second and third owners is helping more motorists make the switch underlining the importance of energising the new EV market to support a fair transition for all. Maintaining momentum requires reliable affordable and green EV charging up and down the country and incentives to get all of Britain on board the net zero transition. Middleaged model bright spot for used EVs Ian Plummer Auto Trader commercial director said The maturing electric markets been a bright spot this year particularly those middleaged models which have benefitted from a significant softening in price. Used EVs are currently selling at their fastest rate in eight months while those aged 35yearsold which are now broadly at price parity with their petrol counterparts are the fastest selling segment of the used car market and by some margin. Clearly when the price is right buyers are eager to make the switch. Plummer said the overall used market got off to a roaring start in 2024 despite some market challenges. Retail prices have returned to seasonal norms used cars sold at near record pace and strong consumer demand. Plummer added With such solid market fundamentals combined with improving economic and political stability weve every expectation the market will continue on its trajectory and predict overall sales will be up around 5 by the end of the year. James Hosking managing director of AA Cars said the used car market is showing interesting trends with petrol and diesel vehicles becoming more expensive while EV prices are seeing significant decreases. Hosking said The latest AA Cars Used Car Index showed that the average prices of the UKs most soughtafter used petrol and diesel cars increased 3.5 between the first and second quarters of 2024. Drivers wanting to reduce their emissions will see the biggest savings with prices of EVs and hybrids falling 12 in the same period. Were expecting EV sales to reach record levels this year as more and more drivers are convinced to take the plunge thanks to the considerable savings. Despite persistently high interest rates impacting the cost of living the Bank of Englands recent base rate reduction may bolster consumer confidence and further stimulate the used car market. Remarkable resilience despite margin pressure Philip Nothard Cox Automotive insight director described the Q2 results for the UK used car market as encouraging and played out as Cox had forecasted. He said Despite subdued retail demand margin pressures and ongoing constraints in prime threeyearold retail stock the market has shown remarkable resilience marking its sixth consecutive quarter of growth. The surge in BEV sales is particularly promising reflecting a significant shift in buyer preferences. However Nothard said it was important not to get too giddy when looking at the second half of 2024. He concluded Supply will remain a battleground and the composition of the car parc is shifting faster than consumer preferences. While used values may have settled compared to the volatility seen last Q4 this years Q4 will likely see renewed turbulence as the rush to meet ZEV mandate targets intensifies in the new car market.","2024-08-08 00:00:00","2024-08-08 13:07:12.156582"

It said the rules governing financial services could be streamlined for rules that could be removed or simplified where there is a crossover with the new Consumer Duty regulations that were introduced last summer. Consumer Duty introduced a new set of regulations to set higher and clearer standards of consumer protection across financial services and requires firms to put their customers needs first. The FCA acknowledged the complexity of its own rulebook and said reducing that complexity could lower costs for firms encourage innovation and help support the risk appetite needed to support growth ultimately boosting international competitiveness and the economy over the longterm. Launching the review Nikhil Rathi chief executive of the FCA said The Consumer Duty marked a major shift for firms and consumers by setting higher and clearer standards of consumer protection and requiring firms to put their customers needs first. We now want to seize the opportunity of the Duty and the move to a clear outcomesbased approach to streamline our rulebook lowering costs for businesses and supporting the competitiveness and growth of the economy. The FCA has recently delayed the publication of its review into motor finance and has now said it wont be able to publish further guidance until May 2025. In a recent FCA official podcast Rathi said the FCA has certainly found issues in the ways that motor finance was offered or incentivised in the past and the ongoing review will determine the breadth of those issues and what system of redress will be needed.

The new Paua PINS project Private Infrastructure Network Solution has received 300000 from the Department for Transport DfT to collaborate on a 10month initiative to make depot charger sharing a reality. Its hoped this solution could be rolled out on a wider basis to help boost confidence for businesses switching to electric commercial vehicles. Manufacturers are launching ever more new battery electric vehicle BEV models with 28 now available to UK buyers up from 25 last year. There were however fewer fleets going green in July according to the latest Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders SMMT. New BEV van registrations fell by 14.6 in July to 1415 units. Since January BEVs have accounted for 5.1 of all new vans a share that includes those weighing up to and equal to 3.5 tonnes 4.8 and those weighing above 3.5 to 4.25 tonnes 0.3 meaning zero emission uptake is down 7.0 across the year. Given manufacturers are mandated by the Government to ensure BEVs comprise at least 10 of new van sales in 2024 the SMMT said demand needs to increase significantly in the remainder of the year especially with the number plate change month of September coming soon. It said mandated targets for vansuitable charging infrastructure are needed fast while the SMMT is also urging for the Plugin Van Grant to remain beyond April 2025 if more businesses are going to decarbonise. Mike Hawes SMMT chief executive said Declining uptake of the very greenest models remains a major concern however given the UKs zero emission ambitions. Industry has invested and continues to commit billions into this transition but manufacturers cannot deliver this alone. Given the paucity of vanspecific charging infrastructure we need an equally ambitious mandate for chargepoint rollout one that supports operators right across the country. The PINS project Paua Cenex Oxfordshire County Council Suffolk County Council Daf and a host of leading fleets industry bodies and software providers are collaborating on the 10month PINS project to make depot sharing a reality on a commercial scale for fleets. Cenex Oxfordshire County Council Suffolk County Council and Paua have agreed to demonstrate the solution to decarbonising business vehicles. The two county councils will provide depot locationsvehicles to share with others while Cenex will explore the technical and commercial challenges of this approach. Currently only possible by privatebilateral agreements PINS will enable the sharing of information on private depots to start the formation of a shared private network. It is seeking to overcome the challenges associated with the sharing of private or restricted EV charging infrastructure for example local authority sites or commercial depots through research and demonstration with key partners to show how this solution can be extended to a wider variety of depots and fleets. Outcomes from the Paua PINS project will include a barriers and challenges assessment a demonstration of the use of the depot sharing solution an evaluation of the future scalability and a best practice guide to give other local authorities a better understanding for implementation locally. This years Automotive Management Live on November 13 at the NEC will hold a special panel featuring the Association of Fleet Professionals as well as leading fleet customers to give their perspective on how retailers can make a success in the fleet market.

Its new threecar strategy and the JEA Jaguar Electric Architecture platform itll sit on has been years in the making. Any platform decision is probably a 1215year decision because youve got five six years in the gestation and then youve got probably a maximum of eight nine years to leverage the platform once you launch it the man leading Jaguar into its new premium allelectric chapter Rawdon Glover told AMs colleagues on consumer title Car. So its not a shortterm decision that you can flex mid midstream. Jaguars road car plan is headed towards three EVs in the next three to four years but on track things are already full EV. Jaguar has been there or thereabouts in Formula E for the last few years winning the constructors championship this year. This platform has got to be the right thing for us well into the next decade. So what we got to think about not what is happening in 2024 what is happening in the early part of 2030 2032. Its going to basically last that time period Glover told Cars digital editor Curtis Moldrich. Whats more the return to ICE is happening more amongst volume brands and Jaguars new strategy under the Reimagine plan is to leave the volume drug far behind and produce cars that appeal to the wealthiest of customers. Glover pictured talked about discretionary spend the future Jaguar brand must tempt people who dont need to buy a Jaguar they want to. You do it because theres that sort of that inherent demand for it. Weve got to create that demand. To a certain extent thats agnostic to the platform and thats the job that Jaguar needs to do. Its never about the powertrain first its got to be about the design of the brand first and then those good things come second. The language of JLR has already changed. It talks about its journey to realise a sustainability driven vision of modern luxury and the electrification of our House of Brands. To some its language might seem a little pretentious the Jaguar website currently presents The 2024 collection in common parlance it means its model lineup of FPace IPace and FType. But as it goes all Guccistyle how do you create a new vision and a new demand First you retire everything else after all you cant create an allnew vision with last years work in the same gallery. It also means a rethink of the sales points required. In the UK the network of Jaguar dealerships is being slashed from around 80 sites to about 2030 all that is required for the future Jaguar collections. It puts the network more in line with existing luxury car brands Bentley and Ferrari. Meanwhile existing customers will still be able to get their car serviced at JLRs Archstyle sites for years to come. Jaguar has already begun to sunset its new car range but the rate of its deceleration can be managed to an extent. I think at an enterprise level well look at how we optimise that blend of full electrification combustion engine and hybrid said Glover adding that itll only be a short to medium term solution with sales continuing to 2025 in certain markets. Glover was also keen to point out the support infrastructure for the current models would remain for years to come with customers able to buy new Jaguars in 2024 with confidence. The existing cars will be supported but theyll look rather dated compared to Jaguars new trilogy. Its not about running them to side by side we really need to close one chapter Glover told Car. Then we have a period to prepare and generate demand for the next chapter. Then well go live with the next chapter.","2024-08-06 00:00:00","2024-08-08 13:07:12.611461"

Alex Wright SVAs managing director has issued this warning following dealer part exchanges getting much older and becoming more expensive to get forecourt ready if the car is in a poor mechanical condition. Consumers are also targeting dealers to buy their used car after approaching other outlets such as car buying services where their offer price has already been downgraded based on mechanical problems discovered during a test drive. The older part exchange sector is on a knife edge between dealers buying the right car at the right price or overpaying for a car in poor mechanical condition and losing money he said. I have never seen the part exchange market as divided. The only peace of mind is to test drive a customers car before offering to buy it. Ignore the test drive and risk a repair bill that could equal the value of the car as vehicle servicing parts and even paint repair costs continue to rise he added. Wright suggests dealers should start by checking the cars service history and covering enough miles on the test drive to check whether warning lights go out or stay lit up. Then if the used car does have visible mechanical problems the work must be priced up thoroughly based on parts availability parts prices and repair lead times. If a dealer wants to buy the customers car after carrying out their own checks they can offer a realistic price based on its actual mechanical condition.

Aiden Perris had spent almost 20 years working in MercedesBenz dealerships in the Midlands including the last eight years as a general manager at a MercedesBenz Retail Group dealership which became part of LSH Auto UK. As Perris sat outside a pub in Sutton Coldfield having a drink on the evening of July 25 he was struck by an outofcontrol car which mounted the pavement on Boldmere Road. West Midlands Police arrested a woman at the scene on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and detectives have appealed for witnesses and anyone with dashcam or CCTV footage that could help them piece together why the car was out of control. At the opening of an inquest this week Birmingham Coroners Court was told that ambulance staff rushed to the scene but were unable to save Perris life. The Dublinborn automotive manager who had a wife Victoria and two young children Liam and George would have been 48 at his birthday next month. Friends have launched a GoFundMe page to raise donations to support Perris family. The inquest was adjourned until any criminal proceedings are complete. In a statement his family said A tragedy that has taken our beloved Aiden from us far too soon. Aiden was a devoted husband a proud father a loving son brother uncle and a dear friend to many. As a true Irishman Aiden always lived his life to the fullest creating unforgettable memories that we will cherish forever. He showed us the value of hard work and will be remembered for the caring funny and selfless person that he was. Aiden was a family man whos wish would be for us to pull together and support each other during this time. The driver was released but investigations are ongoing. Detective sergeant Rich Evans of from West Midlands Polices Serious Collision Investigation Unit told Birmingham Live A family has lost a father a son uncle and a brother in such tragic circumstances. We are continuing to investigate the collision and ask any witnesses who have not made contact with us to do so. Any evidence no matter how small can be helpful. Our family liaison officers will continue to support Aidens family and our investigation team are working tirelessly to understand how the collision occurred. The Serious Collision Investigation Unit SCIU can be contacted at sciuwestmidlands.police.uk or by calling 101 and quoting log 5400 of 25 July. Among the dozens of comments and tributes was one from Adam McCullagh an AM Awardwinning former colleague of Perris wrote on LinkedIn I had the pleasure of calling Aiden not just a colleague but a true friend and a mate having worked together for many years during our time at MB watching him grow from many roles in sales to being my general sales manager and then having the honour and privilege of mentoring him as he took on his first general manager role. Those that know Aiden know what a genuinely caring funny and witty family man he was. A true one off who will be sadly missed by all who had the pleasure to know him. And Jenny Farnborough director of sales and operations at MercedesBenz UK said Aiden was a great colleague and a fun guy who could be relied upon to do what he said. Mark Lewis finance sales manager at MercedesBenz Finance UK added He was a lovely man good with people serious about his job and family but never took himself too seriously. I genuinely enjoyed working with him he was always so supportive.","2024-08-07 00:00:00","2024-08-08 13:07:12.722523"

First lets look at what fuel injectors are and what their use is. Fuel injection systems may vary but their purposes are always the same Producing energy. Efficient fuel combustion. Reducing polluting emissions. Facilitating smooth driving and engine reliability. Diagnostic capability. Modern digital electronic fuel injection systems achieve these goals more efficiently and consistently than previous fuel systems. Also they can better atomize the fuel. Fuel injection provides smoother and more consistent throttle response quick throttle reaction times easier cold starting accurate adjustment of fuel taking into account the changes in ambient temperatures and air pressure and more stable idling with the main aim of reducing overall vehicle emissions. Therefore fuel injectors are a vital part of every fuel system and it is important to maintain them. So how does an injector cleaner improve the performance of vehicles Gasolinepetrol direct injection In a direct injection engine fuel is injected directly to the combustion chamber as opposed to injection before the intake valve. Due to their location the injectors are exposed to more heat and pressure. Costly materials and higherprecision electronic management systems are required. Direct injection offers alternative methods in fuel distribution with wall guided spray guided and air guide applications using different manifold and piston configurations and intricately shaped injector nozzles to direct the fuel and air mixture to the point of ignition improving combustion efficiency. Diesel engines Common rail Modern diesel engines use common rail or unit injector direct injection systems now with the introduction of Piezo injectors. These systems closely monitor and adjust the fuel delivery to maintain performance and emissions values. Diesel or petrol engines Multihole injectors Both diesel and petrol injection systems now incorporate multihole injectors giving finer distribution of fuel within the combustion chamber to promote clean and efficient combustion. Holes the size of a human hair are shaped and cut to disrupt the fuel and enhance the spray pattern. Fuel injectors are very sensitive components and care must be taken when removing or refitting and when replacing a new injector this must be conducted in a clean environment. Any dirt to the injector during fitting can result in damage to the component in its early days of operation. Cleaning the injectors With tight tolerances within the injectors and the location close or inside the combustion chamber small amounts of contamination can have a dramatic effect on the operation and fuel distribution. Poor injector spray patterns lead to incomplete combustion. This will increase contamination buildup in other areas of the engine including oil system intake system and EGR turbo catalyst and DPFGPF diesel particulate filtergasoline particulate filter. One of the impacts is the reduction in exhaust gas temperature when incomplete combustion occurs. Exhaust gas aftertreatment systems rely on temperature to operate correctly to maintain emissions and reduce particulates from the exhaust. Cleaning the injectors can be a simple solution with the addition of an additive to the fuel tank and driving the vehicle as normal. It is important however to select an additive suitable for the system and an additive of quality that can withstand and survive the pressures and temperatures at which the fuel injector operates. Only when these elements are correct will a driver gain the maximum benefit from cleaning the injectors. These benefits range from improved fuel economy better performance and vehicle response lower emissions and reduced contamination impact of other vehicle components such as the engine oil catalytic converters and particulate filters. The driver should feel improved vehicle response smoother running and better starting. The fuel injector is the key component for fuel distribution to the engine. Keeping the injectors clean is a vital part of maintaining vehicles. Done regularly it will help to maintain your customers vehicle and reduce component problems. In the end this will save the driver money. Want to know more For more information click here.","2024-08-05 00:00:00","2024-08-08 13:07:12.832536"

Delphi says that through its Masters of Motion training hub it is committed to helping garages meet the demands future vehicles will present. The aim is to develop a stronger connection with the independent garage and workshop technicians that form the backbone of the aftermarket. Included in the hub are articles training resources and top tips. The following stepbystep guide comes from a constantly expanding series of Delphi videos covering a range of workshop jobs including ADAS calibration diesel injection engine management and more. The process Adjusting the headlights on a Tesla is a similar process to any other vehicle. However technicians should be aware that the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y have some key differences to be aware of including a unique calibration mode and adjustment process. Here Phil Mitchell workshop solutions manager at Delphi talks us through these differences with a stepbystep guide on how to align Tesla headlights at Delphis inhouse training workshop in Warwick. Step 1 Select calibration mode Using the infotainment screen inside the cabin select the car icon service menu and adjust headlights. Step 2 Rear height sensor calibration Take the car for a short test drive allowing the vehicle to calibrate the rear height sensors. A full house of green ticks on the infotainment screen indicates that the vehicle is ready to begin the headlight calibration. Step 3 Position the headlamp aligner Ensure the headlamp aligner is parallel to the front of the vehicle before positioning it over the correct headlight. Adjust the aligner height vertically so the line is in the centre of the headlight. This ensures the best beam pattern in the headlamp beam setter. Step 4 Headlight adjustment Use the steering wheels lefthand scroll button to adjust the headlight up or down and left and right as needed. To adjust the other headlight tap the scroll wheel inwards. Carry out the same process to make the correct adjustments. Once successfully adjusted select X on the screen to navigate away from the menu. This action will return the headlights back to their normal mode of operation. Step 5 Visual inspection Finally perform a full light function check using the Tesla feature light show. This mode sees the vehicle perform synchronised light and movement sequences providing an opportunity to ensure all lights are functioning correctly.

Coowner Gary Cutting says since the site went live six months ago the garage has reduced its monthly subscription costs by 75. He said Were making huge savings now. The new website is a quarter of the cost we were paying previously and the changeover was quick and easy. Bosch recommended Garage Services Online to us and I cant fault them. We got our first website over 24 years ago so we know how important they are even for a busy garage. I wasnt unhappy with the look of the previous site but we needed to rethink the type of work it was attracting. Our lead time had crept up to four weeks which wasnt great for customers. The website was attracting too much low profit work things like timeconsuming engine problems. We were struggling to fit in the quick turnaround work such as a basic service or MOT so something needed to change. Garage Services Online Managing Director Jim Lang said Its tempting to set up a website to attract every single service you offer but that doesnt address the problem of creating a new channel of enquiries that only generates profitable work. Most garages who approach us are already busy. They come to a point where they realise they need a way to attract and filter the work they really want. We approach all our builds with this mindset working with customers to ensure theyre getting the ideal work. Many garages shy away from investing in and improving their online presence. They think a website will bring in more work than they can cope with when in fact the opposite is true. Its a gatekeeper and can become invaluable to their business.

Here febi explains how the unique properties of brake fluid allow the vehicle to remain safe and when and why that fluid needs to be replaced. It is well known that servicing and maintaining a vehicle will prolong its efficiency performance and safety thus increasing its lifespan. Consequently vehicle manufacturers create recommended maintenance schedules for each model which can vary from market to market based on environmental conditions and other factors such as if the vehicle is used for towing or taxi work. Safety checks are carried out on the vehicles steering suspension and braking systems and common service replacement items include engine oil and oil air fuel and cabin filters. Fluids that are not replaced regularly such as brake fluid may be considered as optional. A vehicles brake discs and pads may receive regular checks but the condition of the brake fluid receives less attention. Fig.1 Hygroscopic properties Brake fluid is hygroscopic which means it likes to absorb moisture. This can be a problem because higher moisture content leads to a lower boiling point therefore the older the brake fluid the less effective it is. Brake fluid is an important safetycritical component within a vehicles braking system. febi DOT 4 DOT 4 LV low viscosity DOT 4 Plus DOT 5.1 and DOT 5.1 EHV electric and hybrid vehicle are fullysynthetic brake fluids based on glycols containing oxidation and corrosion inhibitors. They can also prevent vapour bubble formation and have improved dry and wet boiling point properties. Friction during the braking process generates heat some of this heat is absorbed by the brake fluid which must meet the requirements defined in the applicable standards Dry boiling point of the brake fluid with no water content C Wet boiling point of the brake fluid with water content C pH value of the brake fluid The parameters are defined by standards FMVSS No. 116 SAE J1703 ISO 4925 and PNEN ISO 2719 201608 and constitute some of the basic criteria for determining the suitability for use. These parameters are summarised according to standards SAE J1703 and ISO 4925 dry and wet boiling points viscosity as well as FMVSS No. 116 pH value in the table show in Fig.1. Sample of clean fresh brake fluid compared to old brake fluid with a high moisture content. The importance of replacement The boiling point of a brake fluid is a temperature at which gas bubbles form. As soon as gas bubbles form the pressure in the brake system can no longer be maintained because the gas can be compressed. The consequence is a sudden reduction in braking effectiveness which can lead to an accident. The hygroscopic property of brake fluid is required so that any water present distributes itself evenly throughout the liquid. If water is collected in a specific area the boiling point would lower to approximately 100C. However if the water is dissolved in the brake fluid up to a proportion of 3 per cent for example the boiling point would remain significantly higher than 100C where the risk of bubble formation is much lower. Several factors affect and accelerate the absorption of water. These include the storage of brake fluid in open unsealed packaging for longer periods noncompliance with brake fluid service intervals damaged brake system components e.g. cracks or splits in the outer layers of flexible brake hoses or damaged sealsgaskets. The hygroscopic properties of the brake fluid stem from the glycol content. This allows the fluid to gradually absorb more and more water which also means that it needs to be changed on a regular basis. Vehicle manufacturers generally recommend changing the brake fluid every 30000 to 50000 kilometres or every two years subject to operating conditions. Without regular maintenance the high moisture content held within the brake fluid corrodes the internal metal components of the brake system contributing to seizing brake calipers failing antilock brake modulators and the deterioration of the internal brake hose rubber causing blockages within the braking system. Electric and hybrid requirements Electric and hybrid vehicles are becoming more popular. Therefore febi has added an enhanced brake fluid specifically for the requirements of EHVs. In technical terms when a vehicles battery is full the brake system cannot take advantage of regenerative braking. Therefore the brakes must do all the work without any support from the engine or electric motor braking. This creates the need for a brake fluid with a higher dry and wet boiling point typically 274C and 184C respectively as well as increased lubricity and viscosity. In normal conditions the brakes are used less because of the proportion of work done by regenerative braking. However they must still be in perfect working condition when required. This creates the need for enhanced corrosion protection due to the high electrical currents in the vicinity of the braking system and a lower conductivity fluid. To ensure an effectivelyfunctioning braking system while guaranteeing driving safety in all road traffic conditions brake fluid must be regularly checked and replaced as necessary. febi brake fluids are developed in accordance with the binding quality standards and requirements of vehicle and brake system manufacturers to meet all requirements for current brake systems including electronicallycontrolled brake systems which need to perform reliably within fractions of a second.

Still its a premium offering arguably worth the premium price tag especially for a car that garnered a fourstar Euro NCAP score in December 2023. The ZRV is in fact the latest Honda car to feature the companys advanced suite of Honda Sensing technologies as standard. Combined with a comprehensive airbag system and impressive allround collision performance the ZRV achieves high levels of both active and passive safety. A limitedtime financing offer with deposit contribution further enhances its value proposition making it a worthwhile consideration for buyers seeking a wellrounded hybrid SUV. The offer which ends on September 30 allows buyers to benefit from a 6.9 APR with a 2500 deposit. Based on 37month Personal Contract Purchase PCP deal the total amount payable on a ZRV eHEV Full Hybrid Elegance is 44757.73 at 439 per month. Supported by a comprehensive ownership package of a fiveyear service plan fiveyear warranty and fiveyear roadside assistance makes the ZRV an even more attractive proposition. That aside its a car that is not only comfortable and enjoyable to drive but one that also offers a wellcrafted space that is practical and contemporary that gives the cabin a superior edge. One of the highlights of the ZRVs interior is its userfriendly control layout. Climate control functions are operated through separate buttons and dials making adjustments straightforward without distracting from driving. Standard features across the range include a 10.2inch digital drivers display and a nineinch touchscreen with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay Behind the standardfit leather steering wheel the drivers display offers customizable graphics and multiple views allowing drivers to tailor the display to their preferences. The screens dark background with coloured graphics ensures excellent readability. While the ZRVs interior design is excellent it predominantly features a somewhat sombre colour scheme the design and quality of materials ensure the cabin feels upmarket With simple lines metallic detailing and a horizontal bar housing the air conditioning vents the ZRVs interior feels contemporary and userfriendly. The ZRV is available in three trim levels Elegance Sport and Advance. Even the entrylevel Elegance is wellequipped while the trim of the midrange Sport which AM test drove adds conveniences like wireless smartphone charging extra USB ports a powered tailgate and halfleather seats. The toptier Advance trim enhances the luxury further with a panoramic sunroof and a Bose sound system. Visibility is excellent thanks to a large rear window ample wing mirrors and relatively slim Apillars. Standard features like a rearfacing camera and front and rear parking sensors enhance manoeuvrability. Synthetic leather has been used for the dashboard and surrounds the buttonpress gear selector giving a premium touch to the interior. After driving the car for 2000 miles over three months keeping surfaces clean was easy through the choice of material surfaces. One downside for families would be the relatively small boot space at 370litres 1291 litres with the rear seats folded flat does not compare as well to rivals in the SUV space although AM found that a weekend family outing with four medium sized suitcases was more than easily accommodated.

SEE CAR REGISTRATIONS BY BRAND DOWNLOAD PRESS RELEASE AND DATA TABLE The UK new car market rose by 2.5 in July delivering two years of consecutive growth according to the latest figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders SMMT. With 147517 new cars reaching the road it was the best performance for July since 2020 when a reopening of dealerships following four months of lockdown saw a surge in deliveries to fulfil demand pentup demand.1 As has been the pattern for the year Julys growth was sustained entirely by the fleet sector which recorded a 13.0 increase in registrations to achieve a 62.0 market share. Private demand continued to diminish falling by 11.1 to account for 36.2 of deliveries in the month although the growing popularity of salary sacrifice purchasing will contribute to this decline. Electrified vehicle demand outpaced the overall market accounting for four in 10 42.0 new cars registered in the month. Hybrid electric vehicle HEV uptake increased by 31.4 to achieve a 14.5 market share while plugin hybrids PHEV grew 12.4 to take 8.9 of registrations. Battery electric vehicle BEV volumes meanwhile were up 18.8 resulting in an overall market share of 18.5. While the private share of the BEV market continues to fall 17.2 went private buyers compared with 20.3 last year private BEV volumes did increase by a marginal 0.9. Overall BEVs account for 16.8 of the new car market year to date. With zero emission vehicles mandated to comprise a minimum 22 of each brands new car registrations over the full year the pace of transition needs to increase significantly. The latest industry outlook2 however suggests that such a surge is looking increasingly unlikely given the current market conditions. While the outlook anticipates overall market growth in 2024 expectations have been revised downwards since April3 with 1.968 million new car registrations now forecast by the end of the year. The anticipated BEV share of the market has also been revised downwards to 18.5 from the 19.8 expected in April. Last weeks interest rate cut was already priced in to the latest outlook but further cuts would be welcome helping reduce the costs of finance and making new car purchases more accessible to more consumers. Mike Hawes SMMT Chief Executive said Two years of new car market growth against a backdrop of a turbulent economy is testament to the sectors resilience and the attractiveness of the deals on offer. Weakening private retail demand however particularly for EVs and despite generous manufacturer discounts is the overriding concern. More people than ever are buying and driving EVs but we still need the pace of change to quicken else the UKs climate change ambitions are threatened and manufacturers ability to hit regulated EV targets are at risk. Achieving market transition at the pace demanded requires greater support for consumers and with the allimportant new numberplate month of September beckoning action on incentives and infrastructure is needed now.

The performance is in comparison with a strong July in 2023 the best in three years however which came amid a recordequalling 17 consecutive months of market growth. With that exceptional run of demand ending only in May this year the overall market remains robust with registrations up 2.7 year to date to become the best first seven months since 2019.1 The dip in demand in July affected most segments with uptake of the largest vans down 12.0 to 16814 units still representing more than two thirds 68.1 of the overall market while 8.4 fewer new mediumsized vans were registered. Deliveries of pickups and 4x4s also fell by 5.1 and 2.1 respectively. There was a spike in demand for the smallest vans in July however with registrations more than doubling 117.6 to 929 units. While smaller volumes can accentuate fluctuations the new small van market has been robust across 2024 with demand up 42.0 in the year to date supported by new model launches. Manufacturers are also launching ever more new battery electric vehicle BEV models with 28 now available to UK buyers up from 25 last year providing competitive payloads and ranges to meet a wide variety of needs. There were however fewer fleets going green in July with new BEV registrations down 14.6 to 1415 units. Since January BEVs have accounted for 5.1 of all new vans a share that includes those weighing up to and equal to 3.5 tonnes 4.8 and those weighing above 3.5 to 4.25 tonnes 0.3 meaning zero emission uptake is down 7.0 across the year.2 Given manufacturers are mandated by government to ensure BEVs comprise at least 10 of new van sales in 2024 demand needs to increase significantly in the remainder of the year especially with the number plate change month of September coming soon. While major industry investment has put more BEVs on the road than ever before uptake must accelerate with all stakeholders playing their part. Mandated targets for vansuitable charging infrastructure are needed fast while the Plugin Van Grant must be maintained beyond April 2025 if more businesses are going to decarbonise. The latest outlook for the year remains robust with 351000 units expected this year a 2.8 increase on 2023. However the BEV share of LCV registrations under 3.5t has been revised downwards to 6.6.3 Mike Hawes SMMT Chief Executive said Britains new van market remains robust following a recordequalling growth run and despite a dip in June and July demand will resume with manufacturers offering impressive product lineups. Declining uptake of the very greenest models remains a major concern however given the UKs zero emission ambitions.

It was industrial carmaker Henry Ford who said If everyone is moving forward together then success takes care of itself. But its only in recent years that the secondhand car market has begun to embrace this spirit of collaboration. In the past couple of decades the industry has changed dramatically. Technology is changing the way people buy cars as well as the cars they buy. More recent entrants to the market fintechs and marketplaces like ourselves are introducing new ways of doing things. Dealerships and lenders that have been established for decades are having to adapt to the digital world and we are seeing a lot of collaboration to improve the way we all work together. But its not just about tech much of the disruption we are currently experiencing is about improving our industry. Trade associations and regulatory bodies are making everyone consider more responsible working practices. While competition and profit have always been motivating forces in our businesses we should see this as an industry wide challenge one that we can tackle together to make our ecosystem fairer and more transparent for the customer and bring more equality to the workplace. Putting the customer first Its now over thirty years since Vauxhall began one of the earliest manufacturer approved used car schemes guaranteeing the quality of some its secondhand models. This approach was soon adopted by other manufacturers including Ford as the increase in consumer confidence was seen to translate into a boost in sales. Despite this and other positive actions the used vehicle and car finance sectors have historically been plagued by reports of bad practice and unfair lending rates. Thankfully the modern used car and finance sectors are now a very different place and this goal is shared by many of our peers and partners. It has been placed firmly on the agenda for all finance providers with the introduction of the Consumer Duty by the Financial Conduct Authority FCA tasking businesses to ensure that good outcomes for the customer are at the heart of everything they do. Measures such as these depend on the cooperation of all involved. A hugely important role is played by trade associations such as the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders SMMT and the Finance and Leasing Association FLA. Whats more these associations dont simply foster collaboration between competing organisations they also help to drive the whole industry forward. Collaboration breeds success This shared goal of putting the customer first is at the heart of the movement towards collaboration. Its in everyones interest for the customer experience to be as smooth as possible when they are looking for cars and finance online. Clarity and the quality and speed of response are key and technology can help to facilitate that. However its important not to lose the human touch. Providing the option of speaking to a trained human operative ensures that all customers can have the level and type of service and communication they need. While putting customers first our industry also has a duty of care towards employees. Automotive retail is a significant UK employer providing many wide and varied career opportunities but it is not known for being the most diverse wed all like to see a more inclusive diverse working environment across the industry. Becoming an employer of choice helps an organisation to remain competitive but its important to bring everyone along on this journey of selfimprovement. Dont get me wrong Im not suggesting that competition doesnt exist nor that its a bad thing. The used car market is currently doing well. SMMT figures show that it is currently hitting a five year high in terms of sales. But we cant take this for granted. For all of us to thrive we need to make sure that we share common goals and a mutual desire to make ours an industry that is recognised as being transparent fair and responsible. This will help us to realise Henry Fords vision and success will take care of itself. Aimee Gethin chief operating officer Zuto","2024-08-05 00:00:00","2024-08-08 13:07:13.338742"

Download the used car sales report for Q2 2024 The UKs used car market has grown for the sixth consecutive quarter rising 7.2 in Q21 according to the latest figures published today by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders SMMT.

The increased supply of electric vehicles to second and third owners is helping more motorists make the switch underlining the importance of energising the new EV market to support a fair transition for all.

TampH Motor Services Paul Horn says the move which saw the permits which are mainly for residential use move to a digitalonly form in March threatens our existence adding that it is undermining our contribution to the countys economic growth. However the Warwickshire County Council said it moved the permits online due to high levels of misuse which closed off a minor loophole that allowed nonresidents to apply for permits as part of informal arrangement between the council and local firms. He has now called on Warwickshire County Council through a Change.Org page to either go back on its decision and reinstate the permits for business use or bring in specific business parking permits. The page has so far received 525 signatures. Writing on that petition page he said Business parking permits arent a luxury theyre a necessity that enables smallscale businesses in Warwickshire to provide quality service without the burden of disproportionate expenses. Therefore we urge Warwickshire County Council to reinstate these permits and provide a suitable solution that supports the lifeblood of our local economy. In response a Warwickshire County Council spokesperson told Warwickshire World Following several years of public complaints regarding high levels of misuse across the county a new digital service was introduced to replace the outdated paperbased system. Historically informal arrangements in various towns allowed nonresidents to access the residents parking scheme affecting space availability. The transition to the digital system has resolved many of these issues. Consequently some organisations and businesses are now unable to obtain resident permits. The council acknowledges the impact this has had and will continue to review the situation. If deemed necessary we may seek public consultation on these matters.","2024-08-05 00:00:00","2024-08-08 13:07:33.334296"

It added that there is regional disparity in EV skills although London and the South East have the largest proportion of electric cars the region does not have the greatest proportion of EVtrained technicians. That would be the East of England where 9.5 are EV trained. In Northern Ireland just 3.7 of technicians are qualified to work on EVs. The IMI also forecasted that the national EV skills gap will widen to 16000 technicians by 2035.
